    "Invoices": "Select only records where transaction_type = 'invoice', explicitly excluding credit memos, adjustments, payments, and all other non-invoice transaction types, irrespective of status, balance, or associated metadata.",
    "Number of invoices": "Count distinct transaction_id values where transaction_type = 'invoice' to ensure each invoice is counted exactly once, excluding non-invoice transactions such as payments or returns and avoiding overcounting from multiple line items per invoice.",
    "Last time ... sold": "Identify the most recent transaction_date for a product/service by joining with chart_of_accounts to ensure the associated account_type is in ('Income', 'Other Income'), thereby confirming it represents a valid sale; return the single latest such transaction using ORDER BY transaction_date DESC with LIMIT 1 to avoid incorrect results from applying MAX() on an unfiltered dataset.",
    "Spend on Job Materials": "Sum the debit amounts from expense-type accounts (where account_type is 'Expense' or 'Other Expense') that have 'Job Materials' in the account name or description, without joining to product, employee, or customer tables or filtering by 'Product_Service' fields which may capture non-expense transaction details.",
    "Sold Strollers": "Refers exclusively to revenue-generating transactions for strollers, requiring a filter on account_type in ('Income', 'Other Income') via a join with the chart of accounts to confirm the transaction represents a sale, not returns, adjustments, or internal transfers.",
    "Expense account": "An expense account must be confirmed by joining with the chart_of_accounts table to ensure the account type is 'Expense' or 'Other Expense', as transaction labels or debit activity alone are insufficient to classify an account as an expense.",
    "Last quarter": "Refers to the most recently completed calendar or fiscal quarter—defined by fixed quarterly boundaries such as Q1: January–March—determined dynamically relative to the current date; must be filtered using quarter-aware date logic that computes the exact start and end dates of the prior quarter, not as a rolling 90-day or 3-month window from today.",
    "Sold to": "Refers to outbound sales transactions such as invoices or sales receipts issued to the specified customer, filtered by customer identifier and transaction_type in ('invoice', 'sales receipt') while excluding returns, voids, and other non-sale transaction types.",
    "Monthly spend on [Vendor]": "Aggregate total 'debit' amounts by calendar month for transactions associated with the specified vendor, using date truncation to the start of each month for grouping; do not restrict to the current month or involve customer-related tables.",
    "In Q3 last year": "Filter records to the third quarter (July 1 to September 30) of the prior calendar year using relative date arithmetic from the current date—such as truncating to the start of last year and adding six months—without hardcoding any absolute dates; ensure correct temporal alignment by deriving the period dynamically and reference customer data directly from the transaction table if available to avoid erroneous joins.",
    "Biggest expense": "Identify the account with the highest cumulative sum of debit (or negative) amounts over a period, restricted to accounts classified as 'Expense' or 'Other Expense' in the chart_of_accounts, by aggregating outflows per account and excluding non-expense types; this is not determined by a single transaction amount or by summing across all account types indiscriminately.",
    "This fiscal year": "Refers to the current fiscal year-to-date period, dynamically calculated from the organization's fiscal year start date (e.g., April 1 or July 1) using relative date functions anchored to current_date, ensuring alignment with the correct fiscal calendar without hardcoded ranges or rolling 12-month assumptions.",
    "In This year": "Refers to transactions occurring from January 1st of the current calendar year up to and including the current date, accurately captured using transaction_date BETWEEN date('now', 'start of year') AND date('now') to ensure precise boundary inclusion and avoid reliance on strftime or implicit date handling.",
    "Expense accounts": "Identify expense accounts by joining transactions with the chart_of_accounts table and filtering for account_type IN ('Expense', 'Other Expense') to ensure only genuine outflows are included; this filter is required because debit activity alone does not signify an expense, as it can also increase assets or reduce liabilities.",
    "In May last year": "Filter records to include only those occurring within the full calendar month of May (from May 1 to May 31) of the previous calendar year, using dynamic date arithmetic—such as adjusting the current date by one year and setting the month to May with precise start and end boundaries—to avoid hardcoded values and ensure correct temporal alignment for timestamps with time components.",
    "This month": "Filter records from the start of the current calendar month to the current date inclusive, using date('now', 'start of month') for the lower bound and date('now') for the upper bound to ensure accurate time-range confinement within the present month.",

    "Last 12 months": "Refers to the 12 completed calendar months, defined from the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current date to the last day of the previous month, using date truncation for alignment with standard financial reporting periods; must be combined with appropriate filters for transaction type, account category, and invoice status to ensure accurate aggregation in business context.",
    "Mean invoice value": "Calculate the average of the 'credit' field across transactions where transaction_type = 'invoice', explicitly excluding non-invoice transactions to prevent distortion; using any other field or omitting the filter invalidates the result.",
    "Invoices created for Service": "Identify transactions where transaction_type = 'invoice' and the associated service context is confirmed through pattern matching (e.g., using instr) in account, description, or similar text fields, rather than relying solely on exact matches in a Product_Service column to ensure comprehensive and accurate service linkage.",
    "Last 7 days": "Refers to the inclusive date range from midnight 7 days ago to the latest timestamp of the current day; implement using Transaction_DATE >= DATE('now', '-6 days') AND Transaction_DATE <= DATE('now', '23:59:59') to ensure precise calendar-day alignment, bounded filtering, and exclusion of future dates.",
    "Last month": "Refers exclusively to the full prior calendar month, defined as the period starting at the first day of the previous month and ending at the last day of that same month, computed using deterministic date arithmetic such as 'start of month' minus one month for the start and 'start of month' minus one day for the end; explicitly excludes any rolling 30-day or relative time window ending on the current date.",
    "Bill received from": "Indicates a transaction where the customer is the recipient and the vendor is the sender, with transaction_type = 'bill' and proper alignment of vendor-customer roles in joins; specifically represents an outgoing charge to the customer (credit to the vendor), requiring both correct role assignment and classification as a bill.",
    "This year to date": "Refers to valid sales transactions from the start of the current calendar year (January 1) to the current date, inclusive, using date('now', 'start of year') as the lower bound and current_date as the upper bound; explicitly excludes rolling periods and requires filtering for confirmed, non-adjusting transactions only.",

    "Highest number of holdings in bond categories": "Requires counting the number of individual bond holding records per fund-manager pair from a detailed holdings table (e.g., mf_bondportifoliodetail), not using a precomputed or aggregated numeric field like BondFundN.",
    "Top ten funds and managers": "Implies the SQL must return both the fund name (e.g., secuabbr) and manager name (e.g., manager), derived through grouping by both fund and manager identifiers before ordering by the count of holdings.",
    "Stocks and monthly time periods": "Requires selecting both the stock identifier/name and the corresponding time period (e.g., enddate) to reflect when the financial criteria were met, not just the stock information alone.",
    "Gross profit margin": "Refers to the financial ratio calculated as (GrossProfit / OperatingRevenue), not the absolute 'GrossProfit' value. A margin greater than 1 implies a ratio exceeding 100%, which requires division, not direct comparison of gross profit amounts.",
    "Established after 2010": "Requires extracting the year component from EstablishmentDate using a function like strftime('%Y', date) and comparing it numerically to '2010', to ensure only companies founded from 2011 onward are included. Direct comparison of a date column to a string '2010' is ambiguous and unreliable.",

    "Largest shareholder with the most rights issues": "Implies finding the shareholder with the highest actual subscription or allocation in rights issuance events during the specified year, determined by aggregating or maximizing values like 'actualshares' from event-based tables, not selecting the highest 'HoldingPCT' from static ownership records.",
    "Holdings for 21国债01": "Refers to positions in a specific bond issue, identified by bond code '21国债01' in bond holding tables using the correct column (e.g., bondabbr or bond code), not StockCode in stock-centric tables.",
    "Year-on-year changes in operating income": "Refers to the 'MainIncomeGrowRateYOY' field, which directly represents the year-over-year growth rate of operating income and should be filtered for negative values to identify declines.",
    "Establishment date is after 2015": "Requires extracting the year from the date using a function like strftime('%Y', EstablishmentDate) and comparing it numerically to '2015', rather than comparing the full date string directly to '2015'.",

    "Largest registered capital": "Implies ordering by 'RegCapital' in descending order and limiting to one result to ensure a single fund manager is returned, rather than using a subquery with equality that may return multiple rows in case of ties.",
    "Abbreviation of the fund manager": "The required field 'InvestAdvisorAbbrName' is directly available in the 'mf_investadvisoroutline' table; no join with 'mf_personalinfo' is needed, as such joins may introduce incorrect or redundant data if relationships are not strictly 1:1.",
    "Top ten funds, fund managers, and risk-return types": "Refers to returning only the fund identifier (e.g., SecuAbbr), the fund manager's name, and the descriptive risk-return type (e.g., 'aggressive', 'conservative'), not supporting codes or metrics like SecuCode, PersonalCode, RiskLevel, or the benchmark growth rate value itself.",
    "Highest returns among funds": "Implies ordering by the return metric (e.g., fundreturn) in descending order and limiting to the top result only after applying all filtering conditions, ensuring the ranking is done within the correctly filtered subset.",
    "Company with the highest proportion of bonus shares": "Refers to the entity identified by its official or abbreviated name (e.g., 'ChiNameAbbr') in the dividend table, not a full or alternative name field like 'ChiName', which may not represent the standardized company identifier used in financial disclosures.",

    "Major shareholder in the rights offering": "Refers to shareholders participating in a specific capital event (rights issue) and requires querying a table that records large shareholder subscriptions (e.g., 'lc_largeshsubscription'), not general related-party shareholders.",
    "Stock codes start with 6": "Refers to filtering on the security code (e.g., secucode) field with a prefix '6', not joining through company-level codes or other indirect keys which may lead to incorrect associations.",
    "Listed companies' stock symbol and abbreviated name with actual controllers": "Implies that stock-level attributes (symbol, abbreviated name) and controller information should be linked via a shared security or company identifier where the relationship is direct and unambiguous; using secucode as the filtering key ensures accurate matching of stock data to its associated controller.",
    "Less than 20% of newly added tradable A shares": "Requires comparing the proportion value to 20 if the column stores percentages (e.g., 20 for 20%) or to 0.20 if stored as decimals; the correct threshold depends on the data representation format of the 'Proportion1' column, which must be interpreted based on domain conventions or schema metadata.",

    "Highest benchmark growth rate in the past quarter": "Implies ranking funds by BenchGRForThisQuarter in descending order and returning a top N list (e.g., using ORDER BY and LIMIT), rather than filtering only for the exact maximum value which may miss multiple high-performing funds and does not produce a ranked result.",
    "Equity fund management scale exceeds 10 billion": "Refers to filtering on the EquityFundNV column with a threshold of > 10,000,000,000 (10^10) units, typically in local currency (e.g., yuan), representing total net value under management for equity funds.",
    "Based on the weekly fund benchmark growth rate": "Implies a correct and unambiguous join between the benchmark growth table and fund archives using a reliable key (e.g., InnerCode), not SecuCode, to ensure accurate alignment of performance data with fund records.",
    "Grouped by the highest education level": "Requires including the grouping column (e.g., education) in the SELECT clause alongside aggregate functions to ensure the result shows both the education level and the corresponding count of fund managers.",

    "Stock abbreviation and security code for 600190": "Refers to retrieving the market-traded stock's symbol (AShareAbbr) and its public security identifier (AStockCode), requiring a filter on AStockCode = '600190', not CompanyCode, as CompanyCode represents an internal company ID unrelated to stock ticker lookup.",
    "With dividend records": "Implies filtering for rows where dividend-related fields (e.g., bonusshareratio) are not null, to ensure only companies with actual dividend activity are included, rather than returning all rows in the dividend table.",

    "Conducted share repurchases in 2021": "Requires filtering records where the year of 'AdvanceDate' is exactly 2021 using a proper date function (e.g., strftime('%Y', AdvanceDate) = '2021'), not pattern matching with LIKE, to avoid incorrect inclusion of malformed or non-2021 dates containing '2021' as a substring.",
    "Average annualized return rate of the funds": "Requires computing the average of a representative annualized return per fund, ensuring one value per fund (e.g., by grouping on fund level), to prevent distortion from multiple time-point entries in performance history tables.",
    "Bonds held by 166001": "Refers to retrieving bond holdings from mf_bondportifoliodetail where '166001' is the SecuCode of the fund, requiring a direct filter on SecuCode = '166001', not a join on InnerCode or filtering InnerCode by the SecuCode value.",
    "Highest average return rate for one month": "Requires grouping by fund category and computing the average of 'rrinsinglemonth' values from the performance table, rather than retrieving a precomputed or unverified 'FundReturnMean' value without aggregation.",
    "Fund category": "Must be obtained by joining with a fund metadata table (e.g., mf_fundarchives) using a shared key like 'innercode', as the category is not inherently present in performance tables.",
    "Investors of a stock": "Refers to entities that hold or acquire shares in the company, typically found in shareholder or ownership distribution records (e.g., 'lc_legaldistribution'), not in transfer, trustee, or authorization tables which may include non-investor roles.",
    "Bond holdings": "Refers to the specific bonds held in the portfolio and requires returning identifiable bond attributes such as bond abbreviation (bondabbr) or name from the bond portfolio table, not just holding volume or market value.",
    "Fund manager information": "Should be sourced from a fund-level metadata table (e.g., mf_fundarchives) that links managers to funds via InnerCode, rather than joining directly with a manager dimension table like mf_fundmanagernew, which may not reflect current per-fund assignments.",
    "Security code '510130'": "Is a string-based SecuCode used to identify the fund in the bond portfolio table; filtering must be done on SecuCode = '510130' (with quotes for string comparison), not on InnerCode as an integer.",
    "Conducted IPOs in 2012": "Requires filtering IPO events based on the year of the IPO date (e.g., using strftime('%Y', EndDate) = '2012'), where EndDate represents the IPO event date, not using LIKE pattern matching which is error-prone and may capture incorrect years.",
    "Each industry": "Refers to the industry classification at the time of IPO, which should be sourced directly from the IPO table (e.g., csrcindustryname), not joined from external industry tables that may reflect current or multiple outdated classifications and introduce duplicate records.",
    "Held by the most funds": "Refers to counting the number of distinct funds holding each stock (typically via COUNT(*) after grouping by stock), then returning the stock with the highest count; requires proper grouping and aggregation semantics.",
    "Top ten stocks in terms of total share capital": "Requires grouping by stock identifier (e.g., SecuCode or chinameabbr) and using an aggregate function like MAX(TotalShare) to capture the peak share capital per stock during the period, then ordering and limiting to 10 to ensure distinct stocks are ranked by their highest value.",
    "Benchmark growth rate for six months is positive": "Requires filtering with condition benchgrfor6month > 0 on the benchmark growth rate table (e.g., mf_benchmarkgrowthrate), ensuring data reflects the correct time horizon and metric.",
    "Positive benchmark growth rate for LOF funds this month": "Refers to a binary existence check (yes/no) for at least one record where FundType = 'LOF' and BenchGRForThisMonth > 0; should use EXISTS or LIMIT 1 to confirm presence rather than selecting the actual growth rate values.",
    "Actual controllers who are not from mainland China": "Refers to identifying companies based on the nationality of their actual controllers, requiring a filter on NationalityDesc != 'mainland China' and returning distinct company identifiers (e.g., CompanyCode) rather than controller names or other attributes belonging to the controller.",
    "Highest commission fees": "Requires ordering by commission in descending order and limiting to one result to ensure a single company is returned, rather than using equality to MAX(Commission) which may return multiple companies in case of ties.",
    "Total turnover": "Implies an aggregated sum of turnover values, requiring a GROUP BY on company and trade date with HAVING or WHERE condition on SUM(TurnoverValue) > 1000000000, not filtering individual rows with TurnoverValue > 1000000000.",
    "Executive names and positions": "Refer to data stored in a separate executives table (e.g., lc_executivesholdings), requiring a join on companycode to retrieve correct leadername and positiondescription; 'TransfererName' from lc_sharetransfer does not represent company executives and should not be used.",

    "Average annual return rate": "Refers to the average of yearly return rates across funds, requiring a metric that captures performance on a per-year basis (e.g., single-year returns), not the average of 'annualized returns since inception' which reflects long-term compounded performance from each fund's start date.",
    "Annual return rate": "Implies a time-bound measure of return over calendar or fiscal years, not lifetime annualized returns; thus, it requires data filtered or aggregated by specific years rather than inception-to-date metrics like AnnualizedRRSinceStart.",
    "Resignation dates are before 2020": "Requires extracting the year component from the DimissionDate (e.g., using strftime('%Y', DimissionDate)) and comparing it as a string or converting to integer for numeric comparison; direct string comparison of full date values can lead to incorrect results due to lexicographic ordering.",
    "Listed companies under actual control": "Requires counting distinct companies grouped by the controller's nationality (e.g., 'nationalitydesc' in 'lc_actualcontroller'), not by company registration state in tables like 'lc_stockarchives'.",
    "Public mutual fund companies": "Refers to entities identified by 'fundcompanycode' in the awards data (e.g., mf_awards), and should be counted directly using distinct values from this field without joining to investment advisor tables.",
    "First quarter of 2021": "Requires filtering enddate for dates within January to March 2021 (Q1), not just a single date like '2021-03-31'; multiple year-end dates may exist within the quarter.",
    "Year-end net asset values in Q1": "Implies that the enddate must correspond to a year-end valuation date falling within Q1; the query should ensure that only actual year-end records (not all Q1 dates) are considered, requiring alignment between fiscal year-end and the Q1 2021 window.",
    "Largest number of shareholders for a listed company": "Implies identifying both the maximum shareholder count and the associated company (e.g., by name or ID), not just returning the aggregate value. The SQL must include the company identifier in the SELECT clause and ensure correct filtering by year using date functions on 'enddate'.",
    "Annualized return exceeding 10% since inception": "Requires using a return metric that specifically covers the entire period from the fund's start date (inception), not an arbitrary annualized return over a different time window; must verify the column represents returns since inception, not e.g., last 1-year or 3-year.",
    "Group and count funds in each category": "Requires joining fund performance data with fund metadata (e.g., via innercode) to access both the fund type/category (e.g., FundTypeName) and performance metrics, as category information is typically stored separately from performance records.",

    "Circulating A-shares": "Refers to shares that are currently tradable in the market and must be sourced from a table tracking floating or marketable shares over time (e.g., 'lc_sharesfloatingschedule'), not from static share structure tables like 'lc_sharestru'.",
    "Listed companies in the telecommunications industry and the computer industry": "Refers to the total count of distinct companies operating in either the telecommunications or computer industries, requiring a single aggregate COUNT over a unified set of company codes to avoid double-counting and ensure inclusion of both industry groups.",
    "Telecommunications and computer industries": "May be represented by variations in naming (e.g., 'communications' vs. 'telecommunications') and require pattern matching or inclusive filtering (e.g., using LIKE or IN with multiple variants) rather than exact string equality to capture all relevant industry classifications.",
    "Positive returns in the 'one-month' indicator period": "Requires filtering on a period or cycle column (e.g., indexcycle = 'one-month') to ensure only returns corresponding to the one-month timeframe are considered, not just any record with a positive single-month return value.",

    "In March 2020": "Requires filtering using standard date functions (e.g., strftime('%Y-%m', date_field) = '2020-03') rather than pattern matching on textual month names, which is unreliable with numeric/ISO date formats.",
    "Circulating shares in A-share market": "Refers to free float or freely tradable shares, which should be sourced from a table like lc_freefloat that specifically tracks free float data (e.g., 'afloats'), not total A-shares from lc_sharestru which may include non-tradable or locked-in shares.",
    "Non-tradable A-shares": "Refers to restricted or non-listed shares that cannot be freely traded; must be filtered using a column representing restricted/non-listed shares (e.g., 'NonListedShares'), not 'NonRestrictedShares' which represents tradable shares.",
    "Since 2019": "Refers to calendar years starting from 2019 onward; requires extracting the year component from EndDate (e.g., using strftime('%Y', EndDate)) to ensure proper filtering by year, rather than relying on direct date comparisons that may be affected by time components or formatting inconsistencies.",
    "Main operating income has exceeded": "Implies evaluating the condition (mainoperincome > 100000000) per company per year starting from 2019; distinct companies should be counted only if they meet the threshold in at least one year within the period, requiring year-level aggregation or filtering semantics.",
    "Top ten funds on the 2021 Fund Profit Ranking": "Requires ranking funds by their total profit in 2021 through aggregation (e.g., sum(totalprofit)), then selecting the top 10; it must not rely on precomputed rank columns like FundReturnRank, as the ranking must be derived from profit values.",
    "Fund Profit Ranking": "Implies a dynamic ranking based on profit metrics (e.g., totalprofit), not a static return-based rank; therefore, SQL must compute profits first and order by them, rather than using a pre-ranked table or column.",
    "Newly added tradable A-shares exceeding 1 million": "Refers to filtering records where the 'NewMarketableAShares' field is greater than 1,000,000, correctly interpreted as > 1000000 in SQL.",
    "Average number of funds managed per fund manager": "Refers to the mean of the 'NumberOfFunds' column directly, assuming it already represents the count of funds per manager; therefore, use AVG(NumberOfFunds) rather than SUM(NumberOfFunds) / COUNT(DISTINCT PersonalCode), which incorrectly reconstructs the average if the column is already at the manager level.",
    "Total share capital of more than 1 billion A-shares": "Requires filtering on the A-share-specific column (e.g., 'totalashare') rather than total shares across all classes (e.g., 'TotalShares'), to exclude B-shares or other non-A share types.",

    "Annual amount of new loans added": "Refers to a time-series of values reported annually, requiring selection of both the amount (e.g., SubjectSum) and the corresponding period (e.g., enddate) to capture temporal trends, not a single static value filtered by subject name.",
    "Join on innercode": "Financial databases often use 'innercode' as the standardized internal identifier to accurately link fund metadata (e.g., in mf_fundarchives) with performance data (e.g., in mf_benchmarkgrowthrate); using alternate keys like 'SecuCode' may result in incorrect or unreliable joins due to potential mismatches in external code mappings.",
    "ETF funds with benchmark growth rate": "Requires filtering fund types to 'ETF' in the fund metadata table and joining with benchmark data on a reliable primary key (e.g., innercode) to ensure accurate association of performance metrics to the correct fund.",
    "Tenure exceeds 1000 days": "Refers to the fund-specific management duration (e.g., 'managementtime' in mf_fundmanagernew), not the total employment duration (e.g., 'EmploymentAll' in mf_managerexperience). The filter must apply to the period the manager has managed the specific fund.",
    "Earliest establishment date": "Implies ordering by establishmentdate in ascending order and limiting to one result using LIMIT 1 to return a single unambiguous row, rather than using equality with MIN(establishmentdate) which may return multiple rows if there are ties.",
    "Monthly change in circulating share capital": "Requires computing the difference in 'FloatShare' between consecutive 'EndDate' values for each 'SecuCode', using window functions or lag operations to calculate period-over-period deltas, rather than returning raw monthly values.",
    "Frozen pledge amount": "Refers to the current total value or volume of pledged shares that are frozen, and must be matched to the correct column (e.g., 'involvedsum') representing the actual frozen amount, not 'InitialPledgeSum' which reflects the initial pledged value at the time of transaction.",
    "Ten-year benchmark growth rate exceeding 50%": "Refers to filtering on benchgrfor10year > 50 in the mf_benchmarkgrowthrate table, where the growth rate is stored as a percentage value (e.g., 50 means 50%), and should be used without including the rate value in the output unless explicitly asked.",
    "Fund identifier join logic": "In financial fund databases, InnerCode is typically the correct key to link fund-related tables (e.g., between mf_benchmarkgrowthrate and mf_fundarchives), as it represents the internal fund identifier; using SecuCode may incorrectly join on security-level codes and produce inaccurate results due to mismatched entity granularity.",
    "Investor type": "Refers to the classification category (e.g., 'general investor', 'institutional investor') of a client or entity, not the name or code of an investment advisor. Must be retrieved from a table and column representing client/entity classifications, not advisor metadata.",

    "From 2008 to present": "Requires filtering using a date-aware condition, such as extracting the year from 'enddate' via strftime('%Y', enddate) >= '2008' or comparing against a date literal, not treating 'EndDate' as a numeric value.",
    "Circulating A-share capital": "Refers specifically to the portion of A-shares that are tradable or floating, excluding restricted shares, and must align with the correct column (e.g., unrestricted tradable shares) rather than general 'floating' share columns like AFloats which may not reflect official circulating capital definitions.",
    "Benchmark annualized growth rate since inception": "Refers to a performance metric that must be explicitly annualized (compounded average return per year since inception) and not a cumulative or total growth rate; the selected column must represent this specific calculation, not just any growth rate field.",
    "Top 5 companies in terms of commission fees": "Refers to retrieving only the company identifier (e.g., short name 'chinameabbr') of the five highest-paying companies based on 'commission' in descending order; additional columns like 'Commission' or 'CompanyCode' should not be included in the SELECT clause unless explicitly requested.",
    "One-year and two-year return rate": "Refers to specific performance metrics typically stored in dedicated fields (e.g., rrinsingleyear and rrintwoyear) that must be explicitly filtered; 'FundReturn' and 'FundReturnMean' are not reliable proxies unless confirmed by schema context.",
    "Annualized standard deviation of returns": "Requires scaling the raw standard deviation (e.g., daily or monthly) by the square root of the number of periods in a year (e.g., sqrt(12) for monthly, sqrt(252) for daily), not selecting unadjusted ReturnSD values directly.",
    "Annualized downside risk": "Requires applying annualization to the downside risk metric, typically by multiplying the periodic downside risk by the square root of the number of periods per year, rather than using unadjusted DSRisk values.",
    "Since 2022": "Requires filtering based on the actual economic event date (e.g., 'advancedate' or issuance date), not the database 'InsertTime', which reflects when the record was entered into the system and may not correspond to the timing of the share issuance.",
    "Total number of A-shares": "Requires aggregating (e.g., SUM) Ashares values per company from tables like lc_sharestru, as multiple records may exist for the same company over time; failure to GROUP BY CompanyCode and sum results in selecting individual unaggregated entries instead of total A-shares.",
    "Funds that earned more than 1 billion in 2020": "Requires grouping by fund identifier (e.g., secuabbr) and aggregating total profit over all entries in 2020 using SUM(TotalProfit), then filtering with HAVING SUM(TotalProfit) > 1000000000, rather than filtering individual rows with TotalProfit > 1000000000.",
    "excess reserve requirement ratio": "Refers to a specific financial metric that must be explicitly filtered in the query (e.g., by column condition on ratio name or type), not inferred from institution type alone.",
    "Proceeds from a single placement": "Refers to the actual realized proceeds (e.g., 'PlaProceeds') from completed placements, not planned or projected values (e.g., 'PlannedPlaProceeds'). The query must filter and return the actual proceeds amount to meet the business requirement.",
    "Total amount of retail sales": "Requires aggregating (e.g., SUM) the RetailValueOfSCGoods over all records within the past three years for each province and city, not selecting individual EndDate snapshots or returning per-period values.",
    "For the past three years": "Must filter records where EndDate falls within the range starting from three years before the current date up to the present, using a dynamic date condition such as strftime('%Y', enddate) >= strftime('%Y', DATE('now', '-3 year')), rather than selecting only the three most recent EndDate values.",
    "Each province and city in China": "Implies grouping by both Province and City levels; omitting City in SELECT and GROUP BY clauses results in incomplete geographic breakdown and potential data aggregation errors.",
    "Top 10 companies ranked by interest expenses": "Implies selecting only the company identifier(s) (e.g., ChiName or CompanyCode) ordered by InterestExpense in descending order with a limit of 10; it does not include the InterestExpense value in the output.",
    "Positive fund returns": "Refers to current or general positivity in 'fund return' values without an implied time range (e.g., 'since inception'), unless explicitly specified. Should not assume metrics like RRSinceStart without explicit temporal context.",
    "Annualized fund returns": "Refers to the annualized version of the fund's return metric, but only if it is directly labeled as such; should not assume columns like AnnualizedRRSinceStart represent this without explicit alignment to the question’s scope.",
    "Free float ratio of 100%": "Refers to exact equality with 100 in the 'AdjFreeFloatRatio' field, which is correctly interpreted as a numeric comparison without conversion (i.e., use 100, not 1.0 or percentage-formatted values).",
    "Scale exceeding 10 billion": "Financial databases often store fund scale values in scaled units (e.g., hundreds of millions or millions of yuan), so thresholds like '10 billion' must be converted according to the data model's unit convention (e.g., 10 billion yuan = 100 if stored in hundreds of millions).",
    "Equity funds with a scale exceeding 10 billion and hybrid funds with a scale exceeding 5 billion": "Requires identifying fund managers who simultaneously meet both fund size conditions on their respective portfolios, implying a single-row evaluation per manager with both columns (equity and hybrid) above their scaled thresholds.",
    "Two years ago": "Refers to the specific calendar year that was two years prior to the current year, requiring filtering by year equality (e.g., strftime('%Y', date_column) = strftime('%Y', DATE('now', '-2 years'))), not a cumulative condition like 'date <= DATE('now', '-2 years')'.",
    "Equity freeze quantity": "Refers to individual equity freeze events recorded in the primary table lc_sharefp, where the proportion of total shares (PCTOfTotalShares) and the number of shares involved (InvolvedSum) are directly associated with a specific shareholder (FPSHName).",
    "Equal to or greater than 0.05% of the total share capital": "Means filtering records where PCTOfTotalShares >= 0.05, representing the percentage threshold on a per-record basis in the lc_sharefp table, not aggregated or cumulative proportions from separate summary tables like lc_sharefpsta.",
    "Top 5 companies ranked by main operating income": "Requires selecting only the company name (e.g., ChiNameabbr) and ordering by MainOperIncome in descending order with LIMIT 5; the result should not include the income value unless explicitly requested.",

    "Net value growth rate during their tenure": "Refers to the fund's net asset value (NAV) growth calculated specifically over the period a manager was in charge of that fund, requiring alignment of performance data with the exact start and end dates of the manager's tenure for that fund.",
    "Top 5 funds and fund managers": "Requires pairing each fund-manager relationship uniquely by tenure period, ensuring that the performance metric reflects the fund's NAV growth only during that specific manager's active management period, not a pre-aggregated or individual performance score.",
    "Highest bond market value": "Refers to the maximum market value specifically allocated to bonds in a fund's portfolio, which must be identified by filtering on bond-related holdings (e.g., via security type or industry classification) and aggregating market value at the fund level before selecting the top-ranked fund.",
    "Highest total profit": "Implies aggregating the sum of 'TotalProfit' for each fund (grouped by fund identifier like SecuAbbr) over the specified period, not selecting the maximum individual 'TotalProfit' value from a single record.",
    "Records of domestic and overseas loans": "Implies selecting only the specific columns related to domestic and overseas loans (e.g., domesticloans, overseasloans), not using SELECT * which retrieves all columns including irrelevant ones.",
    "Before the year 2000": "Requires filtering date fields using proper date functions to extract the year (e.g., strftime('%Y', enddate) < '2000') rather than comparing a date column directly to an integer (EndDate < 2000), which is invalid if EndDate is of date type.",
    "Number of pledged shares": "Refers to the accumulated or current total of shares pledged per shareholder under a consistent financial definition (e.g., from a dedicated pledge status table like lc_sharefpsta), not a conflation of different share events (e.g., transfers, trusts, initial pledges) across multiple tables with differing semantics.",
    "Companies whose stock codes start with '300'": "Requires filtering using SecuCode LIKE '300%' consistently across the correct source table that tracks pledged share positions (e.g., lc_sharefpsta), not applying the filter indiscriminately across unrelated transactional tables without semantic alignment.",
    "Join condition using InnerCode": "The correct linking key between mf_benchmarkgrowthrate and mf_fundarchives tables is 'InnerCode', not 'SecuCode'; using SecuCode may result in incorrect joins due to potential non-uniqueness or inconsistency across tables.",
    "Unit deposits and fiscal deposits": "Refer to specific balance sheet items (e.g., 'corporatesavings' and 'financedeposits') in financial institution reports, which must be correctly mapped to their corresponding column names in the database table.",
    "In 2004": "Requires extracting the year from a date field (e.g., using strftime('%Y', enddate) = '2004') to include all records from that year, rather than comparing the EndDate directly to an integer or string '2004', which would only match exact or invalid date values.",
    "Issued dividends in 2021": "Requires filtering dividend records where the dividendimplementdate falls within the calendar year 2021 using robust date extraction (e.g., strftime('%Y', date) = '2021'), ensuring compatibility across different database systems and avoiding fragile string-based date comparisons.",
    "Price change of the closing price": "Refers to the difference between the closing price at the end of the period and the closing price at the beginning of the period (i.e., last minus first), requiring aggregation to compute a single delta value rather than returning raw daily prices.",
    "In the first quarter of 2021": "Corresponds to the calendar period from '2021-01-01' to '2021-03-31', which can be filtered using date ranges, but must be combined with ordered time-series aggregation to identify first and last closing prices for change calculation.",
    "Total retail sales since records have been kept": "Implies a single aggregated sum over all historical data for the specified region, but requires confirmation whether the underlying field (RetailValueOfSCGoods) contains transaction-level data or pre-aggregated values; applying SUM is only valid if each row represents distinct, additive transactions.",
    "Underwriting amounts below 100 million yuan": "Requires filtering with UnderwritingSum < 100000000, where the amount is in yuan and no unit conversion is needed. The threshold is strict (exclusive), so no rounding or inclusive bounds should be applied.",
    "Daily benchmark growth rate": "Is stored in the mf_benchmarkgrowthrate table and associated with a fund or index via InnerCode; to attribute this rate to a fund manager, the link must go through a fund-level table that connects InnerCode (fund/index) to the responsible manager.",
    "Fund performance during their tenure": "Refers to a tenure-based, absolute performance metric stored at the fund-manager level (e.g., cumulative return over the manager's active period), not relative rankings or single-period returns from a ranking table like mf_fundreturnrank.",

    "Quarterly growth rate in average shareholding proportion": "Refers to a growth rate computed from the average of shareholding proportions over quarters; requires aggregation of shareholding proportions by company and quarter before calculating growth, rather than using a raw 'ProportionGRQuarter' field without verification of its derivation.",
    "Established after 2015": "Requires extracting the year component from the EstablishmentDate field (e.g., using strftime('%Y', EstablishmentDate)) and comparing it to '2015' to include only years greater than 2015 (i.e., 2016 and later); direct comparison of a date column to an integer 2015 is invalid and leads to incorrect filtering.",
    "Average holdings per account have increased by over 20%": "Refers to calculating the percentage change in the average holding value per account over the past six months, requiring comparison of two time-based aggregates; it must not rely on pre-stored growth columns unless confirmed to represent this specific metric.",
    "Increased by over 20%": "Requires interpreting threshold values according to data storage format: if growth is stored as a decimal (e.g., 0.20), the condition should be > 0.20; if as percentage (e.g., 20), then > 20 — verification of column semantics and scale is essential.",
    "Stock issuance": "Refers to the creation and offering of new shares, which is recorded at the security level (SecuCode), not just the company level (CompanyCode). Queries must filter on SecuCode to accurately identify issuance events tied to a specific stock.",

    "Average shareholding proportion": "The average shareholding proportion must be computed using AVG(HoldProportionPAccount) grouped by company and, if applicable, by quarter, ensuring the aggregation occurs before any filtering or growth calculations; individual holdings should not be filtered prior to averaging, and the result must explicitly reflect per-company aggregated values rather than pre-summarized data.",
    "Last year": "Refers to the full, most recently completed calendar year (e.g., 2023 if the current year is 2024), and must be dynamically evaluated using the year component of EndDate matched to strftime('%Y', DATE('now', '-1 year')), ensuring filters are based on date logic rather than record recency or hardcoded values.",
    "Company names": "Refers to the officially recognized abbreviated name of the company, such as 'ChiNameAbbr', which represents the standard display form used in Chinese financial reporting; prefer this over full or language-specific variants unless explicitly required.",
    "Main operating income and main operating profit": "These are financial metrics derived from complete fiscal year periods as reported in annual filings; when referencing 'last year', ensure the data is filtered to the full fiscal or calendar year corresponding to the 'EndDate' to exclude interim, quarterly, or incomplete reporting periods.",
    "Funds and fund managers": "Retrieve fund attributes and associated primary or latest fund manager names by joining mf_benchmarkgrowthrate with mf_fundarchives and relevant personnel tables using InnerCode and PersonalCode, ensuring temporal validity through effective date filtering to resolve multiple managerial assignments to a single current manager.",
    "In 2021": "Filter records where the year extracted from the EndDate column using strftime('%Y', EndDate) equals '2021' to ensure precise matching of all data within the full 2021 calendar year, avoiding unsafe methods like pattern matching with LIKE.",
    "Ranking of funds": "When ranking funds, return only meaningful, human-readable identifiers such as fund names or abbreviations (e.g., 'secuabbr') to represent the ranked entities, ensuring clarity and interpretability; exclude internal or opaque identifiers like 'id' and avoid selecting all columns.",
    "In 2019": "Filter records where any relevant date column (e.g., AdvanceDate, changedate, EndDate) falls within the calendar year 2019 using precise date extraction functions like strftime('%Y', date_column) = '2019', avoiding unsafe string pattern matching such as LIKE '%2019%' which can produce incorrect matches due to partial substrings in full date values.",
    "Fund company": "Refers to the canonical short or official name of the investment advisor (e.g., as in 'InvestAdvisorName'), excluding full legal entities, descriptive phrases, or identifier codes such as 'InvestAdvisorCode'. It must be the standardized name used to identify the firm in fund documentation, not a numerical or alphanumeric code."
