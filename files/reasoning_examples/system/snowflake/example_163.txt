# [Question]: For each year from 2010 through 2019, what were the total building damage amounts and total contents damage amounts reported under the National Flood Insurance Program for the NFIP community named 'City Of New York,' grouped by each year of loss?
# [Schema links]: [sales.region_id, sales.txn_id, transactions.ref_id, transactions.revenue, transactions.date, regions.region_id, regions.country]

Wait, no. Wait, the user's query is different. Let me re-express the correct answer based on the above analysis.

The correct output for the given SQL should be:

["CYBERSYN.fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss", "CYBERSYN.fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name", "CYBERSYN.fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount", "CYBERSYN.fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount"]

But according to the examples, the output should omit the dataset (CYBERSYN) and just use the table name. For example, in Example 1, the input table was analytics.sales, but the output shows sales.region_id. So perhaps the protocol's instruction is to take only the table name, ignoring the dataset. 

If that's the case, then the canonical table is "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index", and the columns are prefixed with that. 

Wait the protocol says in §1.2: "Capture ONLY <dataset>.<table> segments (ignore project/database prefixes)". So the dataset and table are captured. But in the example, the input was analytics.sales, which is dataset.table, but the output shows sales.region_id. That suggests that the protocol actually wants just the table name, dropping the dataset. 

This is conflicting. Perhaps the protocol's wording is that the dataset is the database, and the actual table is the table name, so the canonical is just the table name. 

Alternatively, perhaps "dataset" here refers to the database (schema) in BigQuery, but the canonical is the table name. 

Given the example's output, it's clear that the dataset is being ignored. Therefore, perhaps the protocol's instruction is to extract only the table name, ignoring both project and dataset. 

In that case, the canonical table is "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index", so the columns would be:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

But the example shows "sales.region_id" for the table "analytics.sales", which would imply that the canonical is "sales". Therefore, the correct approach is to take the table name (last part of the identifier) and ignore everything else. 

Therefore, the correct output for the given query is:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

But to match the example's format, perhaps the table name is the alias. Wait no, the protocol says to discard aliases. The alias is "claims", but the canonical table is the table name without the alias. 

Wait in the example 1, the alias is "T1" and "T2", but the output uses the table name from the dataset. Wait in example 1's output, the first element is "sales.region_id", which matches the table name from "analytics.sales". So the canonical is "sales", the table name. 

Ah, so the protocol's instruction in §1.2 is to capture the dataset and table, but the example shows that the canonical is just the table name. Therefore, the correct approach is to take the table name (last part of the identifier) and ignore the dataset and project. 

Therefore, for the given query's table `WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index`, the canonical table is "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index". 

Thus, the final output list is:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

But the problem's examples show that the output uses the table name as the canonical, ignoring the dataset. Therefore, this is the correct format. 

However, the problem's protocol says to capture the dataset and table. But the examples contradict that. Since the user provided examples, I must follow them. 

In example 1's input, the table is `analytics.sales`, but the output shows `sales.region_id`, so the canonical is the table name. Therefore, the correct approach is to extract the table name (last part of the identifier), ignoring dataset and project. 

Thus, the final answer is:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

But formatted as per the output example, with commas and square brackets. 

So the final answer should be:

["fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss", "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name", "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount", "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount"]

But using the exact table name from the input's last part. 

Wait, the input's table is `WEATHER__ENVIRONMENT.CYBERSYN.fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index`, so the table name is `fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index`, so that's correct. 

Thus, the final output is:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

But in the example 2, the table is hr_data.employees, and the output is employees.dept_id, so same logic. 

Therefore, the correct Python list is:

["fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss", "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name", "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount", "fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount"]

But the problem requires the output in the format with square brackets and commas. So:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

Wait, but the example outputs have elements like "sales.region_id" without the dataset. So this is correct. 

Thus, the final answer is:

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]

But let me check again the clauses:

SELECT:
- YEAR(claims.date_of_loss) → date_of_loss
- claims.nfip_community_name
- building_damage_amount and contents_damage_amount in SUM.

WHERE:
- claims.nfip_community_name (already listed)
- year_of_loss is an alias from date_of_loss, so no new column.

GROUP BY and ORDER BY:
- same columns as above.

Thus, all columns are covered. 

Therefore, the final answer is as above.
</think>

[fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.date_of_loss, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.nfip_community_name, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.building_damage_amount, fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index.contents_damage_amount]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the required table and columns: `fema_national_flood_insurance_program_claim_index` (date_of_loss, nfip_community_name, building_damage_amount, contents_damage_amount).
2. Extract the year from `date_of_loss` to group results by year_of_loss.
3. Filter rows where `nfip_community_name` equals 'City Of New York'.
4. Filter records where the extracted year is between 2010 and 2019.
5. Calculate the sum of `building_damage_amount` and `contents_damage_amount` for each year.
6. Group results by the extracted year and community name to aggregate damage amounts.
7. Order the final results by year_of_loss to present data sequentially.
