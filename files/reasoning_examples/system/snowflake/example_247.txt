# [Question]: Which repository with an approved license in `licenses.md` had the highest combined total of forks, issues, and watches in April 2022?
# [Schema links]: ['LICENSES.repo_name', 'LICENSES.license', '_202204.repo', '_202204.type', '_202204.actor', 'fork_counts.forks', 'issue_counts.issue_events', 'watch_counts.watches']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the approved licenses from `licenses.md` by filtering the `LICENSES` table for specific license values.
2. Extract the list of repositories with approved licenses and store them in a CTE named `allowed_repos`.
3. For the month of April 2022 (table `_202204`), count distinct watches (WatchEvent) per repository by parsing the JSON field `actor` for distinct logins and grouping by repository name.
4. Create a CTE named `watch_counts` to store the watch counts.
5. Count issue events (IssuesEvent) per repository in April 2022 by grouping by repository name and store in a CTE named `issue_counts`.
6. Count fork events (ForkEvent) per repository in April 2022 by grouping by repository name and store in a CTE named `fork_counts`.
7. Join the `allowed_repos` CTE with `fork_counts`, `issue_counts`, and `watch_counts` on the repository name to ensure only approved repositories are considered.
8. Calculate the combined total of forks, issue events, and watches for each repository by summing the counts from the joined CTEs.
9. Order the results by the combined total in descending order to find the highest value.
10. Limit the result to the top repository to get the one with the highest combined total.
