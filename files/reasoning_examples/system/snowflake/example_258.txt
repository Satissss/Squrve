# [Question]: Identify the difference in the number of the oldest and youngest users registered between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, from our e-commerce platform data.
# [Schema links]: ['USERS.gender', 'USERS.id', 'USERS.first_name', 'USERS.last_name', 'USERS.age', 'USERS.created_at']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to find the oldest and youngest users based on the `age` column within the specified date range.
2. Convert the `created_at` timestamp from microseconds to seconds by dividing by 1000000.0 to use standard timestamp functions.
3. Filter users where the converted `created_at` falls between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022.
4. For the youngest users, select records where `age` equals the minimum age in the entire table, applying the date filter.
5. For the oldest users, select records where `age` equals the maximum age in the entire table, applying the same date filter.
6. Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create temporary result sets: `youngest` for the youngest users and `oldest` for the oldest users.
7. Include a `tag` column in each CTE to distinguish between 'youngest' and 'oldest' records.
8. Combine the results from both CTEs using `UNION ALL` into a temporary table `TEMP_record`.
9. Calculate the difference by counting the number of oldest users (using a conditional sum on max age) and subtracting the number of youngest users (using a conditional sum on min age).
10. Return the computed difference as `diff` in the final SELECT statement.
