# [Question]: Could you provide the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, including the trip ID, duration in seconds, start date, start station name, route (derived from start station name to end station name), bike number, subscriber type, member's birth year, the member's current age (calculated using the current year), an age classification based on whether the member is younger than 40, between 40 and 60, or older than 60, the member's gender, and the name of the region of the start station? Please exclude any trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender is not specified.
# [Schema links]: ['BIKESHARE_TRIPS.trip_id', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.duration_sec', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.start_date', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.start_station_name', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.end_station_name', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.bike_number', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.subscriber_type', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.member_birth_year', 'BIKESHARE_TRIPS.member_gender', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO.name', 'BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO.region_id', 'BIKESHARE_REGIONS.region_id', 'BIKESHARE_REGIONS.name']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the main table: `BIKESHARE_TRIPS` contains trip details including trip_id, duration_sec, start_date, start_station_name, end_station_name, bike_number, subscriber_type, member_birth_year, and member_gender.
2. Join with `BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO` on `start_station_name` = `name` to get region_id for the start station.
3. Join with `BIKESHARE_REGIONS` on `region_id` to get the region name.
4. Filter trips where `start_date` (converted from microseconds to timestamp) is between '2017-07-01' and '2017-12-31'.
5. Exclude trips with NULL values in `start_station_name`, `member_birth_year`, or `member_gender`.
6. Calculate the member's current age by subtracting `member_birth_year` from the current year.
7. Classify the age into categories: 'Young (<40 Y.O)', 'Adult (40-60 Y.O)', or 'Senior Adult (>60 Y.O)' using a CASE statement.
8. Derive the route by concatenating `start_station_name` and `end_station_name` with a hyphen.
9. Convert `start_date` from microseconds to a date format for display.
10. Select the required columns: trip_id, duration_sec, converted start_date, start_station_name, route, bike_number, subscriber_type, member_birth_year, calculated age, age classification, member_gender, and region name.
11. Order the results by `duration_sec` in descending order to get the longest trips first.
12. Limit the output to the top 5 trips.
