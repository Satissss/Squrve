# [Question]: Can you list all unique pairs of embedding medium and staining substance code meanings, along with the number of occurrences for each pair, based on distinct embedding medium and staining substance codes from the 'SM' modality in the DICOM dataset's un-nested specimen preparation sequences, ensuring that the codes are from the SCT coding scheme?
# [Schema links]: ["IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.SOPInstanceUID", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.Modality", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.CodeMeaning", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.CodingSchemeDesignator", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.CodeValue"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL` (SOPInstanceUID, Modality, CodeMeaning, CodingSchemeDesignator, CodeValue) for DICOM data.
2. Unnest the nested `SpecimenDescriptionSequence`, `SpecimenPreparationSequence`, and `SpecimenPreparationStepContentItemSequence` using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access individual specimen preparation steps.
3. Extract `ConceptNameCodeSequence` and `ConceptCodeSequence` values to retrieve code details (CodeMeaning, CodingSchemeDesignator, CodeValue) for both embedding and staining concepts.
4. Filter rows where `ConceptNameCodeSequence.CodingSchemeDesignator` is 'SCT' to ensure codes are from the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SCT) coding scheme.
5. For embedding medium, identify records with `ConceptNameCodeSequence.CodeValue` '430863003' (representing embedding medium concept) and aggregate distinct `ConceptCodeSequence` values into arrays grouped by SOPInstanceUID.
6. For staining substance, identify records with `ConceptNameCodeSequence.CodeValue` '424361007' (representing staining substance concept) and aggregate distinct `ConceptCodeSequence` values into arrays grouped by SOPInstanceUID.
7. Join the embedding and staining CTEs with the main DICOM table, filtering for `Modality` 'SM' to ensure data from the Specimen Microscopy (SM) modality.
8. Split the aggregated code strings (stored as 'CodeMeaning:CodingSchemeDesignator:CodeValue') to extract only the CodeMeaning component using `SPLIT_PART`.
9. Group the results by the extracted embedding medium and staining substance CodeMeanings, then count occurrences of each pair using `COUNT(*)`.
10. Format the final output to display the CodeMeanings and their occurrence count.
