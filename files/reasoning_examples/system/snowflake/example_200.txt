# [Question]: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.
# [Schema links]: ['history_day.country', 'history_day.postal_code', 'history_day.date_valid_std', 'history_day.tot_snowfall_in']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the target table and columns: `history_day` with columns `country`, `postal_code`, `date_valid_std`, and `tot_snowfall_in`.
2. Filter for US data using `country='US'` and snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches using `tot_snowfall_in > 6.0`.
3. Determine the date range: the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year relative to April 1, 2024.
4. Calculate the reference timestamp: truncate April 1, 2024 to the start of the year (January 1, 2024), subtract one year to get January 1, 2023.
5. Adjust for the first two full weeks: find the end of the second full week after the reference timestamp using `LAST_DAY` with week granularity.
6. Generate the seven days of the target week by creating a sequence of day numbers (1 to 7) and subtracting them from the end of the week date.
7. Create a CTE named `timestamps` to compute the reference timestamp, end of week, and each date in the target week.
8. Use a natural inner join between `history_day` and `timestamps` to match records by date (`date_valid_std`).
9. Select the required columns: `country`, `postal_code`, `date_valid_std`, and `tot_snowfall_in`.
10. Order the results by `postal_code` and `date_valid_std` for clarity.
