# [Question]: Assess whether different genetic variants affect the log10-transformed TP53 expression levels in TCGA-BRCA samples using sequencing and mutation data. Provide the total number of samples, the number of mutation types, the mean square between groups, the mean square within groups, and the F-statistic.
# [Schema links]: ['RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION_UNC_RSEM.sample_barcode', 'RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION_UNC_RSEM.normalized_count', 'RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION_UNC_RSEM.project_short_name', 'RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION_UNC_RSEM.HGNC_gene_symbol', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_MC3.Variant_Type', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_MC3.sample_barcode_tumor', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_MC3.SYMBOL']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION_UNC_RSEM` (sample_barcode, normalized_count, project_short_name, HGNC_gene_symbol) for expression data and `SOMATIC_MUTATION_MC3` (Variant_Type, sample_barcode_tumor, SYMBOL) for mutation data.
2. Create a CTE `cohortExpr` to filter TCGA-BRCA samples for TP53 gene, compute log10-transformed expression (LOG(10, normalized_count)), and exclude null/zero counts.
3. Create a CTE `cohortVar` to filter TP53 mutations and select Variant_Type and sample_barcode_tumor (renamed to sample_barcode).
4. Create a CTE `cohort` by joining `cohortExpr` and `cohortVar` on sample_barcode to combine expression and mutation data for each sample.
5. Compute the grand mean of expression across all samples in `cohort` using a CTE `grandMeanTable`.
6. Compute group means, counts per group (Variant_Type), and group by Variant_Type using a CTE `groupMeansTable`.
7. Calculate the between-group sum of squares (SSB) in `ssBetween` by cross joining `groupMeansTable` and `grandMeanTable`, and computing n * (group_mean - grand_mean)^2 for each group.
8. Calculate the within-group sum of squares (SSW) in `ssWithin` by joining `cohort` and `ssBetween` on group_name, and computing (expr - group_mean)^2 for each sample.
9. Compute the mean square between (MSB) in `numerator` by summing n_diff_sq from `ssBetween` and dividing by (number of groups - 1).
10. Compute the mean square within (MSW) in `denominator` by summing s2 from `ssWithin` and dividing by (total samples - number of groups), and also count total samples (n) and distinct groups (k).
11. Finally, select n (total samples), k (number of mutation types), mean_sq_between, mean_sq_within, and F-statistic (mean_sq_between / mean_sq_within) from `numerator` and `denominator`.
