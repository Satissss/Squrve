# [Question]: How many unique StudyInstanceUIDs are there from the DWI, T2 Weighted Axial, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient series, and T2 Weighted Axial Segmentations in the 'qin_prostate_repeatability' collection?
# [Schema links]: ['DICOM_ALL.collection_id', 'DICOM_ALL.SeriesDescription', 'DICOM_ALL.StudyInstanceUID', 'DICOM_ALL.SegmentSequence']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `DICOM_ALL` (collection_id, SeriesDescription, StudyInstanceUID, SegmentSequence) from the IDC.IDC_V17 schema.
2. Filter the DICOM_ALL table for the collection 'qin_prostate_repeatability' and SeriesDescription in the specified list ('DWI', 'T2 Weighted Axial', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient', 'T2 Weighted Axial Segmentations', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Segmentations').
3. Create a CTE named `relevant_series` to select distinct StudyInstanceUIDs from the filtered results.
4. For the 'T2 Weighted Axial Segmentations' series, handle the SegmentSequence array by using LATERAL FLATTEN to extract individual segments.
5. Create a second CTE named `t2_seg_lesion_series` to select distinct StudyInstanceUIDs from the flattened SegmentSequence where SeriesDescription is 'T2 Weighted Axial Segmentations' and collection_id is 'qin_prostate_repeatability'.
6. Combine the StudyInstanceUIDs from both CTEs using UNION ALL to include all unique instances from both sources.
7. Count the distinct StudyInstanceUIDs from the combined result to get the total number of unique StudyInstanceUIDs.
