# [Question]: Calculate, for each histology type specified in the 'icd_o_3_histology' field (excluding those enclosed in square brackets), the average of the per-patient average log10(normalized_count + 1) expression levels of the IGF2 gene among LGG patients with valid IGF2 expression data. Match gene expression and clinical data using the ParticipantBarcode field.
# [Schema links]: ["PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED.Symbol", "PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED.normalized_count", "PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED.ParticipantBarcode", "PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED.Study", "PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED.icd_o_3_histology", "PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED.bcr_patient_barcode", "PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED.acronym"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the gene expression table (EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN...) and clinical table (CLINICAL_PANCAN...) using the schema links.
2. Filter gene expression data to include only LGG study entries, IGF2 gene symbol, and non-null normalized_count values.
3. Calculate log10(normalized_count +1) for each IGF2 entry and compute per-patient average by grouping on ParticipantBarcode.
4. Extract clinical data filtering for LGG acronym, non-null icd_o_3_histology, and exclude entries with histology in square brackets using regex.
5. Join gene expression and clinical data on ParticipantBarcode (matching bcr_patient_barcode in clinical table).
6. Group the joined data by icd_o_3_histology values and compute the average of the log expression values for each group.
