# [Question]: What is the most common 4-digit IPC code among US B2 utility patents granted from June to August in 2022?
# [Schema links]: ["PUBLICATIONS.publication_number", "PUBLICATIONS.country_code", "PUBLICATIONS.kind_code", "PUBLICATIONS.grant_date", "PUBLICATIONS.ipc.code"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required columns: `publication_number`, `country_code`, `kind_code`, `grant_date`, and `ipc.code` from the `PUBLICATIONS` table.
2. Filter rows where `country_code` is 'US', `kind_code` is 'B2', and `grant_date` is between 20220601 and 20220831.
3. Extract the first 4 characters of each `ipc.code` value to form the 4-digit IPC code (`ipc4`).
4. Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to process array-based `ipc` data into individual rows for code extraction.
5. Exclude rows where `ipc.code` is NULL to ensure valid codes are counted.
6. Group the results by the 4-digit IPC code (`ipc4`).
7. Count the number of `publication_number` entries per `ipc4` group.
8. Sort the groups in descending order by the count of publications.
9. Select the top result with the highest count using `LIMIT 1`.
