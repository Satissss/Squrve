# [Question]: Which are the top five states with the greatest average difference in median income between 2015 and 2018 at the ZIP code level, and what is the corresponding average number of vulnerable employees across wholesale trade, natural resources and construction, arts and entertainment, information, and retail trade industries in 2017 according to the ACS Five-Year Estimates and ZIP code boundaries data?
# [Schema links]: ['ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR.geo_id', 'ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR.median_income', 'ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR.geo_id', 'ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR.median_income', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR.geo_id', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR.employed_wholesale_trade', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR.occupation_natural_resources_construction_maintenance', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR.employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR.employed_information', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR.employed_retail_trade', 'ZIP_CODES.state_name', 'ZIP_CODES.zip_code']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to compute the median income difference between 2015 and 2018 at the ZIP code level, requiring data from `ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR` and `ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR` tables.
2. Create CTEs for 2018 and 2015 median income data, aliasing the median income columns appropriately.
3. Join the 2018 and 2015 CTEs on `geo_id` to calculate the difference (`median_income_2018` - `median_income_2015`) for each ZIP code.
4. Aggregate the median income differences by `geo_id` using `AVG` and filter out NULL values to form the `median_income_diff_by_zipcode` CTE.
5. Identify the need to compute the average vulnerable employees for specified industries in 2017 using `ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR` table and the given vulnerability coefficients.
6. Join the 2017 census data with the `median_income_diff_by_zipcode` CTE on `geo_id` (casting to STRING if necessary) and with the `ZIP_CODES` table on `zip_code` to get state names.
7. Group the results by `state_name` and calculate the average median income difference and the weighted average vulnerable employees using the provided coefficients.
8. Order the final results by `avg_median_income_diff` in descending order and limit to the top 5 states.
