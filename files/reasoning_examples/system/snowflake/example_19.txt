# [Question]: Extract and count the frequency of all package names listed in the require section of JSON-formatted content
# [Schema links]: ["sample_contents.content"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the table and column containing JSON data: `sample_contents.content`.
2. Parse the JSON content to extract the "require" section using `TRY_PARSE_JSON`.
3. Filter records where "content" is not null, non-empty, and "require" exists as a non-null object.
4. Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to expand the "require" object into individual key-value pairs for each package name.
5. Extract the `key` from each flattened row to get package names.
6. Count occurrences of each package name by grouping and aggregating with `COUNT(*)`.
7. Order the final results by count in descending order to show most frequent packages first.
