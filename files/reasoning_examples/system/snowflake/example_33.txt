# [Question]: Can you find the shortest distance between any two amenities (either a library, place of worship, or community center) located within Philadelphia, analyzed through pennsylvania table and planet features points?
# [Schema links]: ["PLACES_PENNSYLVANIA.place_name", "PLACES_PENNSYLVANIA.place_geom", "PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS.geometry", "PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS.all_tags", "PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS.osm_id"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify Philadelphia's geometry from the PLACES_PENNSYLVANIA table where place_name is 'Philadelphia'.
2. Extract amenities from PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS with tags indicating 'library', 'place_of_worship', or 'community_centre' within Philadelphia's boundaries using ST_CONTAINS.
3. Perform a self-cross join on the amenities dataset to compare every pair of amenities (a1 and a2) ensuring uniqueness with a1.osm_id < a2.osm_id.
4. Calculate the distance between each pair using ST_DISTANCE on their geometries converted to GEOGFROMWKB.
5. Assign row numbers to each pair's distance ordered by ascending distance for each a1 partition.
6. Filter rows where row_num = 1 to get the nearest neighbor for each amenity.
7. Select the smallest distance from these nearest pairs using ORDER BY distance ASC LIMIT 1.
