# [Question]: Find the CPC technology areas in Germany that had the highest exponential moving average (smoothing factor 0.1) of patent filings per year, specifically for patents granted in December 2016. For each CPC group at level 4, show the full title, CPC group, and the year with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings.
# [Schema links]: ['PUBLICATIONS.application_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.country_code', 'PUBLICATIONS.grant_date', 'PUBLICATIONS.filing_date', 'PUBLICATIONS.cpc', 'CPC_DEFINITION.symbol', 'CPC_DEFINITION.parents', 'CPC_DEFINITION.level', 'CPC_DEFINITION.titleFull']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Filter the PUBLICATIONS table for German patents (country_code = 'DE') granted in December 2016 (grant_date between 20161201 and 20161231), excluding empty application numbers.
2. Group by application_number to get unique patents, selecting the maximum cpc and filing_date for each.
3. Flatten the cpc array to extract individual CPC codes, keeping only the first occurrence (cpcs.value:"first" = TRUE).
4. Join with CPC_DEFINITION to get the parent hierarchy for each CPC code.
5. Extract the filing year from filing_date by dividing by 10000 and flooring.
6. Flatten the parents array to get all parent CPC groups for each patent.
7. Count the number of patents per CPC group and filing year.
8. Calculate the exponential moving average (using AVG with window function) for each CPC group ordered by filing year, considering all previous years.
9. Filter CPC_DEFINITION for level 4 groups.
10. For each level 4 CPC group, find the year with the maximum moving average.
11. Select the full title, CPC group (with quotes removed), and the year with the highest moving average.
12. Order the results by title and CPC group.
