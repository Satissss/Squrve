# [Question]: How many US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018 contain claims that do not include the word 'claim'?
# [Schema links]: ['PUBLICATIONS.publication_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.claims_localized', 'PUBLICATIONS.country_code', 'PUBLICATIONS.grant_date']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `PUBLICATIONS` with columns `publication_number`, `claims_localized`, `country_code`, and `grant_date`.
2. Filter for US patents with `country_code = 'US'`.
3. Filter for patents granted between 2008 and 2018 using `grant_date BETWEEN 20080101 AND 20181231`.
4. Exclude records where `grant_date` is 0.
5. Filter for B2 patents by checking `publication_number LIKE '%B2%'`.
6. Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` on `claims_localized` to extract individual claims from the structured data.
7. Extract the text of each claim using `claim.value:"text"`.
8. Create a CTE `patents_sample` to store the flattened claims data along with the publication number.
9. In a second CTE `Publication_data`, count for each publication the number of claims that do not contain the word 'claim' using `COUNT_IF(claims_text NOT LIKE '%claim%')`.
10. Group the results by `publication_number` to get the count of non-'claim' claims per patent.
11. In the main query, count the number of patents that have at least one claim without the word 'claim' (i.e., `nb_indep_claims != 0`).
