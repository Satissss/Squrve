# [Question]: Can you list all unique pairs of embedding medium and staining substance code meanings, along with the number of occurrences for each pair, based on distinct embedding medium and staining substance codes from the 'SM' modality in the DICOM dataset's un-nested specimen preparation sequences, ensuring that the codes are from the SCT coding scheme?
# [Schema links]: ['DICOM_ALL.SOPInstanceUID', 'DICOM_ALL.SpecimenDescriptionSequence', 'DICOM_ALL.Modality', 'DICOM_ALL.instance_size']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `DICOM_ALL` with `SOPInstanceUID`, `SpecimenDescriptionSequence`, `Modality`, and `instance_size`.
2. Unnest the `SpecimenDescriptionSequence` and its nested arrays (`SpecimenPreparationSequence`, `SpecimenPreparationStepContentItemSequence`, `ConceptNameCodeSequence`, and `ConceptCodeSequence`) using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to access individual preparation steps and their code sequences.
3. Extract the CodeMeaning, CodingSchemeDesignator, and CodeValue from both the ConceptNameCodeSequence and ConceptCodeSequence for each preparation step.
4. Filter the unnested data for the 'SM' modality and ensure the codes are from the SCT coding scheme by checking the CodingSchemeDesignator.
5. Create a CTE (`slide_embedding`) to aggregate distinct embedding medium codes (where ConceptNameCodeSequence has CodeValue '430863003' and CodingSchemeDesignator 'SCT') per SOPInstanceUID.
6. Create a CTE (`slide_staining`) to aggregate distinct staining substance codes (where ConceptNameCodeSequence has CodeValue '424361007' and CodingSchemeDesignator 'SCT') per SOPInstanceUID.
7. Join the original `DICOM_ALL` table with the `slide_embedding` and `slide_staining` CTEs on `SOPInstanceUID` to combine embedding and staining information for each instance.
8. Flatten the aggregated code strings for embedding medium and staining substance to process each code individually.
9. Split the flattened code strings to extract the CodeMeaning part (the first component before the colon).
10. Group by the extracted CodeMeanings for embedding medium and staining substance to count the number of occurrences for each unique pair.
11. Select the unique pairs of CodeMeanings and their counts as the final output.
