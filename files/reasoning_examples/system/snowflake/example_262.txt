# [Question]: Can you find the shortest distance between any two amenities (either a library, place of worship, or community center) located within Philadelphia, analyzed through pennsylvania table and planet features points?
# [Schema links]: ['PLACES_PENNSYLVANIA.place_name', 'PLACES_PENNSYLVANIA.place_geom', 'PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS.all_tags', 'PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS.geometry', 'PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS.osm_id']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the Philadelphia boundary by selecting the row from PLACES_PENNSYLVANIA where place_name is 'Philadelphia' and store it in a CTE named philadelphia.
2. Extract all amenities (library, place_of_worship, community_centre) within Philadelphia by joining PLANET_FEATURES_POINTS with the philadelphia CTE and filtering using ST_CONTAINS to ensure they are geographically inside Philadelphia.
3. Use LATERAL FLATTEN on the all_tags column to access key-value pairs and filter where key is 'amenity' and value is one of the specified types.
4. Create a self-join on the amenities CTE to compare every pair of amenities, ensuring each pair is only considered once by using a1.osm_id < a2.osm_id.
5. Calculate the distance between each pair using ST_DISTANCE on their geometry columns.
6. Use ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by each amenity (a1.osm_id) and ordered by distance to find the closest neighbor for each amenity.
7. Filter the results to only include the closest neighbor for each amenity (where row_num = 1).
8. Order the resulting distances in ascending order and select the smallest one with LIMIT 1 to get the shortest distance between any two amenities.
