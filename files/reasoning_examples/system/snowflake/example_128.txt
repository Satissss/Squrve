# [Question]: Can you calculate the daily change in the market value of USDC tokens (address `0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48`) for 2023, based on Ethereum transactions? The change should be computed from minting (input pattern `0x40c10f19%`) and burning (input pattern `0x42966c68%`) operations. For each transaction, minting should be positive and burning negative. Extract the relevant amount from the 'input' field as a hexadecimal, convert it to millions, express it in USD format. Group the results by date and order them in descending order.
# [Schema links]: ["transactions.block_timestamp", "transactions.input", "transactions.to_address"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `transactions` (block_timestamp, input, to_address).
2. Filter transactions where `to_address` matches the USDC token address `0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48`.
3. Restrict transactions to those with input patterns `0x40c10f19%` (mint) or `0x42966c68%` (burn) for 2023.
4. Convert `block_timestamp` to a date by dividing by 1e6 to adjust for timestamp resolution and using `TO_DATE`.
5. Extract the numeric portion of the `input` field starting at position 75 for mints and 11 for burns, then convert from hexadecimal to a numeric value.
6. Calculate the daily change by summing the converted amounts multiplied by +1 for mints and -1 for burns, then divide by 1e6 to express in millions.
7. Format the summed value as USD with commas using `TO_CHAR`.
8. Group results by the derived date and order by date in descending order.
