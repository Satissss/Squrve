# [Question]: Among all repositories that do not use any programming language whose name (case-insensitively) includes the substring "python," what is the proportion of files whose paths include "readme.md" and whose contents contain the phrase "Copyright (c)"?
# [Schema links]: 
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `LANGUAGES` (to filter repositories without Python-based languages), `SAMPLE_FILES` (to filter files with "readme.md" paths), and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` (to check for "Copyright (c)" in content).
2. Process the `LANGUAGES` table using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to split language arrays into rows and filter out repositories with languages containing "python" (case-insensitive).
3. Join the filtered repositories with `SAMPLE_FILES` to select files where the path includes "readme.md".
4. Join the resulting files with `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` to retrieve their content.
5. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) `requests` to store the combined data of eligible files (repo, content, path).
6. Calculate the numerator by counting files in `requests` where content contains "Copyright (c)".
7. Calculate the denominator by counting all files in `requests` with "readme.md" paths.
8. Compute the proportion by dividing the numerator by the denominator using a subquery in the final SELECT statement.
