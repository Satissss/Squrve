# [Question]: Which OpenStreetMap ID from the planet features table corresponds to an administrative boundary, represented as multipolygons, whose total number of 'amenity'-tagged Points of Interest (POIs), as derived from the planet nodes table, is closest to the median count among all such boundaries?
# [Schema links]: ['PLANET_FEATURES.osm_id', 'PLANET_FEATURES.geometry', 'PLANET_FEATURES.all_tags', 'PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type', 'PLANET_NODES.id', 'PLANET_NODES.geometry', 'PLANET_NODES.all_tags']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the administrative boundaries from the `PLANET_FEATURES` table by filtering for `feature_type` = 'multipolygons' and tags where key='boundary' and value='administrative'.
2. Extract the `osm_id` and geometry for these boundaries, and calculate the area of each boundary using `ST_AREA(ST_GEOGRAPHYFROMWKB("geometry"))`.
3. Identify Points of Interest (POIs) from the `PLANET_NODES` table by filtering for tags where key='amenity' to get all amenity-tagged nodes.
4. Extract the `id` (as poi_id), geometry (as poi_geometry), and the amenity value (as poitype) for these POIs.
5. For each administrative boundary, count the number of POIs that are located within it using a spatial join with `ST_DWITHIN` (with 0.0 distance to ensure exact containment).
6. Group the results by `osm_id` to get the total number of POIs per administrative boundary.
7. Calculate the median of the total POI counts across all administrative boundaries using `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)`.
8. For each boundary, compute the absolute difference between its POI count and the median POI count.
9. Select the `osm_id` with the smallest absolute difference from the median.
10. Order the results by the difference and limit to 1 to get the closest match.
