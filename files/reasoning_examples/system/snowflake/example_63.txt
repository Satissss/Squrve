# [Question]: How large are the DICOM image files with SEG or RTSTRUCT modalities and the SOP Class UID "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.66.4", when grouped by collection, study, and series IDs, if they have no references to other series, images, or sources? Can you also provide a viewer URL formatted as "https://viewer.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/viewer/" followed by the study ID, and list these sizes in kilobytes, sorted from largest to smallest?
# [Schema links]: ["DICOM_ALL.collection_id", "DICOM_ALL.StudyInstanceUID", "DICOM_ALL.SeriesInstanceUID", "DICOM_ALL.instance_size", "DICOM_ALL.Modality", "DICOM_ALL.SOPClassUID", "DICOM_ALL.ReferencedSeriesSequence", "DICOM_ALL.ReferencedImageSequence", "DICOM_ALL.SourceImageSequence"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify required columns: `collection_id`, `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, `instance_size`, `Modality`, `SOPClassUID`, and referenced sequence fields from `DICOM_ALL`.
2. Filter rows where `Modality` is 'SEG' or 'RTSTRUCT', `SOPClassUID` equals '1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.66.4', and all referenced sequences (`ReferencedSeriesSequence`, `ReferencedImageSequence`, `SourceImageSequence`) have zero elements.
3. Create a CTE `seg_rtstruct` to store filtered data with calculated `viewer_url` using `StudyInstanceUID`.
4. Sum `instance_size` for each group defined by `collection_id`, `StudyInstanceUID`, and `SeriesInstanceUID` to compute total size in kilobytes.
5. Include `viewer_url` in the final output by grouping it with the other identifiers.
6. Sort the results by the summed size (converted to KB) in descending order.
