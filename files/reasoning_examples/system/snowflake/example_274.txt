# [Question]: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station (WBAN '94728')? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code. Please return the starting and ending ZIP Codes of this trip.
# [Schema links]: ['CITIBIKE_TRIPS.start_station_longitude', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.start_station_latitude', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.starttime', 'ZIP_CODES.zip_code_geom', 'ZIP_CODES.zip_code', 'GSOD2015.year', 'GSOD2015.mo', 'GSOD2015.da', 'GSOD2015.wban', 'GSOD2015.temp']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` for bike trip data, `ZIP_CODES` for geographic ZIP code boundaries, and `GSOD2015` for weather data.
2. Filter bike trips to only those that occurred on July 15, 2015, by checking the `starttime` field in `CITIBIKE_TRIPS`.
3. Join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `GSOD2015` to get weather data for the trip date, specifically from the Central Park weather station (WBAN '94728').
4. Use spatial joins to determine the starting and ending ZIP codes for each trip: join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `ZIP_CODES` (aliased as `ZIPSTART`) using `ST_WITHIN` to check if the start station coordinates fall within a ZIP code geometry.
5. Similarly, join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `ZIP_CODES` again (aliased as `ZIPEND`) to find the ending ZIP code based on the end station coordinates.
6. Order the results by the average temperature (`temp`) in descending order to prioritize trips in the highest temperature areas.
7. If multiple trips have the same highest temperature, further order by the starting ZIP code in ascending order (smallest first) and the ending ZIP code in descending order (largest first).
8. Limit the result to the first row to get the single trip that meets all criteria.
9. Select the starting and ending ZIP codes from the respective `ZIP_CODES` aliases for the final output.
