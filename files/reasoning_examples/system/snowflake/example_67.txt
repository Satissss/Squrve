# [Question]: What are the RNA expression levels of the genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1, along with associated clinical information, in bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project?  Use clinical data from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, data about somatic mutations derived from the hg19 human genome reference in Feb 2017.

# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify cases with CDKN2A mutations in TCGA-BLCA project by filtering SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_DCC_2017_02 table for Hugo_Symbol='CDKN2A' and project_short_name='TCGA-BLCA'.
2. Extract case_barcode and Variant_Type from the filtered mutations to create a case list subquery.
3. Join the case list with CLINICAL_GDC_R39 using case_barcode=submitter_id to obtain clinical demographics (gender, vital status, days_to_death).
4. Join the clinical-annotated case list with RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02 using case_barcode to link to RNA expression data.
5. Filter RNASEQ rows to include only HGNC_gene_symbol values in ('MDM2','TP53','CDKN1A','CCNE1').
6. Select required fields: case identifiers, gene symbols, normalized counts, variant type, and clinical data columns.
7. Order results by case_barcode and gene symbol for organized output.
