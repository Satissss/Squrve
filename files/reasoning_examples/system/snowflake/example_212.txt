# [Question]: About the refined human genetic variations collected in phase 3 on 2015-02-20, I want to know the minimum and maximum start positions as well as the proportions of these two respectively for reference bases 'AT' and 'TA'.
# [Schema links]: ['_1000_GENOMES_PHASE_3_OPTIMIZED_SCHEMA_VARIANTS_20150220.reference_bases', '_1000_GENOMES_PHASE_3_OPTIMIZED_SCHEMA_VARIANTS_20150220.start_position']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `_1000_GENOMES_PHASE_3_OPTIMIZED_SCHEMA_VARIANTS_20150220` with columns `reference_bases` and `start_position`.
2. Filter the data to include only records where `reference_bases` is either 'AT' or 'TA'.
3. Create a CTE (A) to store the filtered data with just `reference_bases` and `start_position`.
4. Create another CTE (B) to calculate the minimum and maximum start positions, total count for each reference base, grouped by `reference_bases`.
5. Create a CTE (min_counts) to count how many times the minimum start position occurs for each reference base by joining A with B on `reference_bases` and filtering where `start_position` equals `min_start_position`.
6. Create a CTE (max_counts) to count how many times the maximum start position occurs for each reference base by joining A with B on `reference_bases` and filtering where `start_position` equals `max_start_position`.
7. In the main query, join B with min_counts and max_counts on both `reference_bases` and the respective position values to get the counts.
8. Calculate the proportions by dividing the count of min/max positions by the total count for each reference base, casting to float for decimal division.
9. Select the reference bases, min/max start positions, and their respective proportions.
10. Order the results by `reference_bases` to group the output by base type.
