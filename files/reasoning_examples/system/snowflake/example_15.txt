# [Question]: Retrieve U.S. patents with the number of forward citations within the first 3 years after the patent application date (i.e., patents citing the current patent within 3 years). Only include patents with both backward citations within 1 year before the application date and forward citations within 1 year after the application date. The query should focus on specific CPC categories, sort results by backward citations in descending order, and return the patent with the most backward citations, limiting to one result.
# [Schema links]: [PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION.patent_id, PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION.country, PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION.date, PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION.patent_id, PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION.date, PATENTSVIEW.CPC_CURRENT.patent_id]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `PATENTSVIEW.APPLICATION` (for patent details and dates), `PATENTSVIEW.USPATENTCITATION` (for citation data), and `PATENTSVIEW.CPC_CURRENT` (for CPC category filtering).
2. Calculate backward citations by counting citing patents with dates within 1 year before the application date for each patent.
3. Calculate forward citations by counting citing patents with dates within 1 year after the application date for each patent.
4. Join backward and forward citation counts on `patent_id` to ensure patents have both citation types.
5. Use `CPC_CURRENT` to filter patents with specific CPC categories (though no explicit category filter is applied in the SQL).
6. Combine citation counts into a derived table `filterData` with non-null backward and forward citations.
7. Join `filterData` with `APPLICATION` to validate U.S. patents and ensure country code 'US'.
8. Sort the results by backward citations in descending order to prioritize patents with the most backward citations.
9. Limit the final result to the top record with the highest backward citations.
