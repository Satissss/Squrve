# [Question]: Find the CPC technology areas in Germany that had the highest exponential moving average (smoothing factor 0.1) of patent filings per year, specifically for patents granted in December 2016. For each CPC group at level 4, show the full title, CPC group, and the year with the highest exponential moving average of patent filings.
# [Schema links]: ["PUBLICATIONS.application_number", "PUBLICATIONS.cpc", "PUBLICATIONS.filing_date", "PUBLICATIONS.country_code", "PUBLICATIONS.grant_date", "CPC_DEFINITION.parents", "CPC_DEFINITION.symbol", "CPC_DEFINITION.titleFull", "CPC_DEFINITION.level"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `PUBLICATIONS` (application_number, cpc, filing_date, country_code, grant_date) and `CPC_DEFINITION` (parents, symbol, titleFull, level).
2. Filter `PUBLICATIONS` for patents granted in December 2016 (grant_date between 20161201 and 20161231), country_code 'DE', and non-empty application_number.
3. For each application, aggregate the latest filing_date and max cpc value, then flatten the cpc array to process individual codes.
4. Join with `CPC_DEFINITION` on symbol to map cpc codes to their definitions, filtering for the first element in the cpc array and valid filing dates.
5. Extract parent CPC groups from the parents array using LATERAL FLATTEN to capture all levels, then group by cpc_group and filing_year to count yearly filings.
6. Calculate the cumulative average of filings per year for each cpc_group using a window function over ordered years.
7. Join with `CPC_DEFINITION` again to retrieve the full title and filter for CPC groups at level 4.
8. For each level 4 group, select the titleFull, cleaned cpc_group symbol, and the year with the highest moving average by grouping and selecting MAX(filing_year).
