# [Question]: What are the five longest types of highways within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35') by total length, analyzed through planet features?
# [Schema links]: ["PLANET_FEATURES.geometry", "PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type", "PLANET_FEATURES.all_tags"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify Denmark's boundary by filtering PLANET_FEATURES where feature_type is 'multipolygons' and all_tags contain wikidata='Q35' using LATERAL FLATTEN.
2. Create a CTE named bounding_area to store the geometry of Denmark's multipolygon boundary.
3. Filter highway features by selecting records where feature_type is 'lines' and all_tags contain key 'highway' using another LATERAL FLATTEN.
4. Use ST_DWITHIN to spatially join highway features within Denmark's boundary geometry with zero distance tolerance.
5. Calculate total length of each highway type using ST_LENGTH on geography representation of geometry, aggregated by highway_type.
6. Remove quotation marks from highway_type values using REPLACE function for clean output.
7. Sort aggregated results by highway_length in descending order and limit to top 5 entries.
