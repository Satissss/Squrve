# [Question]: Which Ethereum address has the top 3 smallest positive balance from transactions involving the token at address "0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"?
# [Schema links]: ["CRYPTO_ETHEREUM.TOKEN_TRANSFERS.from_address", "CRYPTO_ETHEREUM.TOKEN_TRANSFERS.to_address", "CRYPTO_ETHEREUM.TOKEN_TRANSFERS.value", "CRYPTO_ETHEREUM.TOKEN_TRANSFERS.token_address"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and filter rows where "token_address" matches '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'.
2. Separate transactions into outgoing ("from_address") and incoming ("to_address") flows, converting "value" to numeric and adjusting sign for outgoing (-1 * value).
3. Calculate total outgoing value per address in "out_addresses" by summing negative values.
4. Calculate total incoming value per address in "in_addresses" by summing positive values.
5. Combine all addresses and their net flows into "all_addresses" using UNION ALL of from/to addresses and their respective totals.
6. Compute net balance for each address by grouping "all_addresses" and summing "total_value".
7. Filter groups with SUM("total_value") > 0 to exclude zero or negative balances.
8. Order the remaining addresses by their net balance in ascending order to get smallest positives first.
9. Limit the result to the top 3 addresses with smallest positive balances.
