# [Question]: Can you find how many utility patents granted in 2010 have exactly one forward citation within the ten years following their application date?
# [Schema links]: ["PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.publication_number", "PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.application_number", "PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.grant_date", "PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.filing_date"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify patents granted in 2010 by filtering `PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS` where `grant_date` falls between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31.
2. Convert `grant_date` and `filing_date` to valid dates using `TO_DATE` after handling invalid values (e.g., when `grant_date` or `filing_date` is 0).
3. Create a CTE `patents_sample` containing `publication_number` and `application_number` of patents granted in 2010.
4. For each patent in `patents_sample`, retrieve its `filing_date` to establish the 10-year window starting from that date.
5. Join with a subquery to access citing patents (`t3`), which includes `citing_application_number` and `joined_filing_date` (citing patent's filing date).
6. Link citing patents to original patents via `cited_publication_number` matching `publication_number` of the original patent.
7. Filter citing patents to those filed between the original patent's `filing_date` and 10 years after.
8. Count distinct `citing_application_number` for each original patent to get the number of forward citations.
9. Create a CTE `forward_citation` storing `publication_number` and its `forward_citations` count.
10. Select the count of patents from `forward_citation` where `forward_citations` equals exactly 1.
