# [Question]: Please generate a report that, for each month in 2021, provides the number of orders, the number of unique purchasers, and the profit (calculated as the sum of product retail prices minus the sum of product costs), where the orders were placed during 2021 by users who registered in 2021 for inventory items created in 2021, and group the results by the users' country, product department, and product category.
# [Schema links]: ['ORDERS.created_at', 'ORDERS.order_id', 'ORDERS.user_id', 'ORDER_ITEMS.inventory_item_id', 'ORDER_ITEMS.sale_price', 'ORDER_ITEMS.order_id', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.product_category', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.product_department', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.product_retail_price', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.product_distribution_center_id', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.cost', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.created_at', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS.id', 'DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS.id', 'USERS.country', 'USERS.created_at', 'USERS.id']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the necessary tables: ORDERS, ORDER_ITEMS, INVENTORY_ITEMS, DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS, and USERS based on the schema links.
2. Filter ORDERS to include only those created in 2021 by converting the timestamp.
3. Join ORDERS with ORDER_ITEMS on order_id to get inventory_item_id and sale_price for each order.
4. Join the result with INVENTORY_ITEMS on inventory_item_id to get product details (category, department, retail_price, cost) and filter for items created in 2021.
5. Join with DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS on product_distribution_center_id to get distribution center details (though not directly used in final select).
6. Join with USERS on user_id to get country and filter for users registered in 2021.
7. Extract the month from the order created_at timestamp for grouping.
8. Group the results by month, country, product_department, and product_category.
9. Count distinct order_ids for number of orders and distinct user_ids for unique purchasers.
10. Calculate profit as the sum of product_retail_price minus the sum of cost.
11. Order the results by reporting_month for chronological reporting.
