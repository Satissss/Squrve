# [Question]: Extract and count the frequency of all package names listed in the require section of JSON-formatted content
# [Schema links]: ['SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.content']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` with columns `id` and `content`.
2. Extract the JSON-formatted content and specifically target the "require" section using `TRY_PARSE_JSON` to parse the JSON and access the "require" key.
3. Create a CTE named `json_files` to store the parsed "require" dependencies for each file ID.
4. Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` on the "dependencies" JSON object to extract each key-value pair, treating each key as a package name.
5. Create a CTE named `package_names` to store the flattened list of package names.
6. Filter out any null package names to ensure data integrity.
7. Count the frequency of each package name using `COUNT(*)` and group by `package_name`.
8. Order the results by count in descending order to show the most frequent packages first.
