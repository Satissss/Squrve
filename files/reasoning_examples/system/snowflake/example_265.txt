# [Question]: Using the 2017 GitHub Archive data for watch events, which three repositories that include at least one Python file (with a .py extension) smaller than 15,000 bytes and containing the substring "def " in its content have the highest total number of watch events for that year?
# [Schema links]: ['_201701.type', '_201701.repo', '_201702.type', '_201702.repo', '_201703.type', '_201703.repo', '_201704.type', '_201704.repo', '_201705.type', '_201705.repo', '_201706.type', '_201706.repo', '_201707.type', '_201707.repo', '_201708.type', '_201708.repo', '_201709.type', '_201709.repo', '_201710.type', '_201710.repo', '_201711.type', '_201711.repo', '_201712.type', '_201712.repo', 'SAMPLE_FILES.id', 'SAMPLE_FILES.repo_name', 'SAMPLE_FILES.path', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.size', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.content']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify that the query requires data from multiple monthly tables for 2017 (from _201701 to _201712) to capture all WatchEvents throughout the year.
2. For each monthly table, extract the repository name from the JSON "repo" field and filter for events where "type" is 'WatchEvent'.
3. Combine all monthly WatchEvent data using UNION ALL to create a comprehensive list of watched repositories for 2017.
4. Create a CTE named `watched_repos` to store the combined repository names from all WatchEvents.
5. Create a second CTE named `repo_watch_counts` to count the total watch events for each repository by grouping the `watched_repos` data.
6. Join the `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` tables on the "id" column to link files with their content.
7. Filter for Python files by checking if "path" ends with '.py'.
8. Apply the size constraint by filtering where "size" < 15000 bytes.
9. Apply the content constraint by checking if "content" contains the substring "def " using POSITION.
10. Join the filtered file data with `repo_watch_counts` on "repo_name" matching "repo" to get the watch counts for repositories that meet the file criteria.
11. Group by repository and watch count to ensure unique repository entries.
12. Order the results by "watch_count" in descending order to get the repositories with the highest watch counts first.
13. Limit the output to the top 3 repositories.
