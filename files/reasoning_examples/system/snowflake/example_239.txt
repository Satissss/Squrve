# [Question]: Can you calculate the number of utility patents that were granted in 2010 and have exactly one forward citation within a 10-year window following their application/filing date? For this analysis, forward citations should be counted as distinct citing application numbers that cited the patent within 10 years after the patent's own filing date.
# [Schema links]: ['PUBLICATIONS.grant_date', 'PUBLICATIONS.publication_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.application_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.filing_date', 'PUBLICATIONS.citation']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the patents granted in 2010 by filtering the PUBLICATIONS table where grant_date falls between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31, handling date conversion from numeric format.
2. Create a CTE named patents_sample to store the publication_number and application_number of these granted patents.
3. For each patent in patents_sample, determine its filing date by joining with the PUBLICATIONS table again to get the filing_date (converted to date format).
4. Identify forward citations by flattening the citation array in PUBLICATIONS to extract cited publication numbers, and join these with patents_sample to find citations where the cited publication matches our sample.
5. For each citing patent, ensure its filing date is within 10 years of the original patent's filing date by comparing dates.
6. Count distinct citing_application_number for each patent in patents_sample to get the number of forward citations within the 10-year window.
7. Create a CTE named forward_citation to store the publication_number and its forward_citations count.
8. Filter the forward_citation CTE to include only patents with exactly one forward citation.
9. Count the number of such patents to get the final result.
