# [Question]: For patent class A01B3, I want to analyze the information of the top 3 assignees based on the total number of applications. Please provide the following five pieces of information: the name of this assignee,  total number of applications, the year with the most applications, the number of applications in that year, and the country code with the most applications during that year.
# [Schema links]: ['PUBLICATIONS.cpc', 'PUBLICATIONS.assignee_harmonized', 'PUBLICATIONS.filing_date', 'PUBLICATIONS.country_code', 'PUBLICATIONS.application_number']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Filter the PUBLICATIONS table for patents with CPC code starting with 'A01B3' using a LATERAL FLATTEN on the cpc array.
2. Create a CTE (PatentApplications) to extract assignee_harmonized, filing_date, country_code, and application_number for these patents.
3. Flatten the assignee_harmonized array to handle multiple assignees per patent and group by assignee name, filing year (extracted from filing_date), and country_code to count applications per assignee per year per country.
4. Create a CTE (AssigneeApplications) to compute year_country_cnt (count of applications) for each assignee, year, and country combination.
5. In RankedApplications CTE, use window functions to sum year_country_cnt per assignee per year (total_cnt) and rank countries within each assignee-year by application count (rn=1 for top country).
6. Create AggregatedData CTE to select only the top country for each assignee-year combination (where rn=1).
7. In the main query, use window functions to calculate total applications per assignee (SUM(year_cnt) OVER) and rank years per assignee by application count (rn=1 for top year).
8. Filter for the top year per assignee (where rn=1) and order assignees by total_count descending.
9. Limit the result to the top 3 assignees based on total applications.
