# [Question]: Can you pull the blockchain timestamp, block number, and transaction hash for the first five mint and burn events from Ethereum logs for the address '0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8'? Please include mint events identified by the topic '0x7a53080ba414158be7ec69b987b5fb7d07dee101fe85488f0853ae16239d0bde' and burn events by '0x0c396cd989a39f4459b5fa1aed6a9a8dcdbc45908acfd67e028cd568da98982c', and order them by block timestamp from the oldest to the newest.
# [Schema links]: ['LOGS.address', 'LOGS.topics', 'LOGS.block_timestamp', 'LOGS.block_number', 'LOGS.transaction_hash', 'LOGS.log_index', 'LOGS.data']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the target table: `CRYPTO.CRYPTO_ETHEREUM.LOGS` contains the Ethereum log data with the required columns.
2. Filter logs for the specific address '0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8' using the `address` column.
3. Separate mint events by filtering logs where the first topic (`topics[0]`) equals '0x7a53080ba414158be7ec69b987b5fb7d07dee101fe85488f0853ae16239d0bde'.
4. Separate burn events by filtering logs where the first topic (`topics[0]`) equals '0x0c396cd989a39f4459b5fa1aed6a9a8dcdbc45908acfd67e028cd568da98982c'.
5. Create two CTEs: `parsed_mint_logs` for mint events and `parsed_burn_logs` for burn events, each selecting `block_timestamp`, `block_number`, `transaction_hash`, `log_index`, parsed `data`, and `topics`.
6. Combine the results from both CTEs using `UNION ALL` to include both mint and burn events in a single result set.
7. Select only the required columns: `block_timestamp`, `block_number`, and `transaction_hash` from the combined result.
8. Order the combined results by `block_timestamp` in ascending order (oldest to newest).
9. Limit the output to the first 5 records using `LIMIT 5` to get the earliest five events.
