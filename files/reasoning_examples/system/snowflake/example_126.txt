# [Question]: Among all multipolygons located within the same geographic area as the multipolygon associated with Wikidata item Q191, but lacking a 'wikidata' tag themselves, which two rank highest by the number of points that lie within their boundaries, and what are their names?
# [Schema links]: ["PLANET_FEATURES.geometry", "PLANET_FEATURES.osm_id", "PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type", "PLANET_FEATURES.all_tags"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the multipolygon associated with Wikidata item Q191 by querying PLANET_FEATURES where feature_type is 'multipolygons' and all_tags contain the key-value pair 'wikidata'='Q191'.
2. Extract its geometry to define the bounding area using a CTE named bounding_area.
3. Retrieve all features within the bounding area using ST_DWITHIN, storing results in bounding_area_features.
4. Create a list of osm_ids with existing 'wikidata' tags within the bounding area (osm_id_with_wikidata).
5. Filter multipolygons in bounding_area_features lacking 'wikidata' tags and having a 'name' tag into polygons_wo_wikidata.
6. Join polygons_wo_wikidata with points (feature_type 'points') in bounding_area_features to count points within each polygon's geometry.
7. Exclude polygons that have 'wikidata' tags via LEFT JOIN with osm_id_with_wikidata and checking for NULL.
8. Group results by polygon name, count associated points, and order descending by count.
9. Limit output to the top 2 entries with their names.
