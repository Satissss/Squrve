# [Question]: Can you provide a daily weather summary for July 2019 within a 5 km radius of latitude 26.75 and longitude 51.5? I need the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures; total precipitation; average cloud cover between 10 AM and 5 PM; total snowfall (when average temperature is below 32°F); and total rainfall (when average temperature is 32°F or above) for each forecast date. The data should correspond to forecasts created in July 2019 for the following day.
# [Schema links]: ['NOAA_GFS0P25.creation_time', 'NOAA_GFS0P25.forecast', 'NOAA_GFS0P25.geography']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table: `NOAA_GFS0P25` with columns `creation_time`, `forecast`, and `geography`.
2. Filter the data to include only forecasts created in July 2019 using `TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(TO_NUMBER("TRI"."creation_time") / 1000000) BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-07-31'`.
3. Restrict the geographical area to within 5 km of latitude 26.75 and longitude 51.5 using `ST_DWITHIN(ST_GEOGFROMWKB("TRI"."geography"), ST_POINT(26.75, 51.5), 5000)`.
4. Use `CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN` on the `forecast` column to handle the nested JSON structure and extract individual forecast entries.
5. Filter forecasts to only include those for the next day by comparing the forecast date with the creation date: `CAST(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(TO_NUMBER("forecast".value:"time") / 1000000) AS DATE) = DATEADD(day, 1, CAST(TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(TO_NUMBER("TRI"."creation_time") / 1000000) AS DATE))`.
6. Group the data by `creation_time` and the derived `local_forecast_date` (cast from the forecast time) to get daily aggregates.
7. Calculate the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures using `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG` on `forecast.value:"temperature_2m_above_ground"`.
8. Compute total precipitation by summing `forecast.value:"total_precipitation_surface"` with `SUM`.
9. Calculate average cloud cover only for times between 10 AM and 5 PM using `AVG` with a conditional case that checks the time and `forecast.value:"total_cloud_cover_entire_atmosphere"`.
10. Determine total snowfall by summing precipitation only when the average temperature is below 32°F using a `CASE` statement with `AVG("forecast".value:"temperature_2m_above_ground") < 32`.
11. Determine total rainfall by summing precipitation only when the average temperature is 32°F or above using a `CASE` statement with `AVG("forecast".value:"temperature_2m_above_ground") >= 32`.
12. Create a CTE named `daily_forecasts` to store the aggregated daily data.
13. In the main query, select the creation time (converted to timestamp), forecast date, and all calculated aggregates from the CTE.
14. Order the results by `creation_time` and `forecast_date` to present the data chronologically.
