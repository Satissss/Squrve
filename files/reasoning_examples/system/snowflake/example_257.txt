# [Question]: Please create a month-by-month report for the year 2023 that focuses on the 'Sleep & Lounge' category, showing for each month the total sales, total cost, number of complete orders, total profit, and the profit-to-cost ratio, ensuring that the order is marked as 'Complete,' the creation date is between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, and the cost data is accurately associated with the corresponding product through the order items. 
# [Schema links]: ['ORDERS.order_id', 'ORDERS.created_at', 'ORDERS.status', 'ORDER_ITEMS.order_id', 'ORDER_ITEMS.product_id', 'ORDER_ITEMS.sale_price', 'PRODUCTS.id', 'PRODUCTS.category', 'PRODUCTS.cost']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the necessary tables: `ORDERS` (order_id, created_at, status), `ORDER_ITEMS` (order_id, product_id, sale_price), and `PRODUCTS` (id, category, cost).
2. Join `ORDERS` with `ORDER_ITEMS` on `order_id` to link orders with their items and sale prices.
3. Join the result with `PRODUCTS` on `product_id` (matching `ORDER_ITEMS.product_id` to `PRODUCTS.id`) to get product category and cost.
4. Filter the data: orders with status 'Complete', created_at between 2023-01-01 and 2023-12-31, and category 'Sleep & Lounge'.
5. Convert the `created_at` timestamp (which is in microseconds) to a readable format and extract the month and year for grouping.
6. Create a CTE (d) to store the joined and filtered data with the necessary columns.
7. In a second CTE (e), use window functions with `PARTITION BY month` and `category` to calculate aggregates: total sales (TPV), total cost, number of distinct orders (TPO), total profit (sale_price - cost), and profit-to-cost ratio ((sale_price - cost)/cost).
8. Select distinct months from CTE e to avoid duplicate rows, including all calculated metrics.
9. Order the final result by month to create a month-by-month report.
