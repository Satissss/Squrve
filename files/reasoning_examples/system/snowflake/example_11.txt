# [Question]: For each publication family whose earliest publication was first published in January 2015, please provide the earliest publication date, the distinct publication numbers, their country codes, the distinct CPC and IPC codes, distinct families (namely, the ids) that cite and are cited by this publication family. Please present all lists as comma-separated values, sorted alphabetically
# [Schema links]: ["PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.family_id", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.publication_date", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.publication_number", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.country_code", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.cpc", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.ipc", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.PUBLICATIONS.citation", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB.family_id", "PATENTS_GOOGLE.ABS_AND_EMB.cited_by"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the target tables and columns: `PUBLICATIONS` (family_id, publication_date, publication_number, country_code, cpc, ipc, citation) and `ABS_AND_EMB` (family_id, cited_by).
2. Create a CTE `fam` to collect distinct `family_id` values from `PUBLICATIONS`.
3. Build a CTE `pub` to calculate the earliest publication date per family and aggregate publication_number and country_code as comma-separated lists, grouped by family_id.
4. Construct a CTE `tech_class` to flatten and aggregate distinct CPC and IPC codes from arrays into comma-separated lists per family_id.
5. Develop a CTE `cit` to map citation publication_numbers to their family_ids and aggregate citing family_ids as a list.
6. Create CTEs `tmp_gpr` and `gpr` to process cited_by publication_numbers, linking them to family_ids and aggregating cited_by family_ids as a list.
7. Join all CTEs on family_id to compile the final dataset.
8. Filter the results where the earliest publication_date falls within January 2015 (20150101 to 20150131).
9. Select required fields from the joined CTEs, ensuring comma-separated lists are sorted alphabetically.
