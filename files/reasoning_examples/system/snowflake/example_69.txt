# [Question]: Assess whether different genetic variants affect the log10-transformed TP53 expression levels in TCGA-BRCA samples using sequencing and mutation data. Provide the total number of samples, the number of mutation types, the mean square between groups, the mean square within groups, and the F-statistic.

# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Filter RNAseq expression data for TCGA-BRCA samples and TP53 gene to create cohortExpr with log10-transformed expression values.
2. Extract mutation types and sample barcodes for TP53 mutations from somatic mutation data to create cohortVar.
3. Join cohortExpr and cohortVar on sample_barcode to link expression values with mutation types in the cohort CTE.
4. Calculate overall mean expression (grand_mean) across all samples in grandMeanTable.
5. Compute group-level means (group_mean) and sample counts (n) per mutation type in groupMeansTable.
6. Calculate sum of squares between groups (SSB) by multiplying group size with squared difference from grand mean for each group in ssBetween.
7. Calculate sum of squares within groups (SSW) by summing squared deviations from group means for each sample in ssWithin.
8. Compute mean square between groups (MSB) by dividing total SSB by degrees of freedom (number of groups - 1) in numerator.
9. Compute mean square within groups (MSW) by dividing total SSW by degrees of freedom (total samples - number of groups) in denominator.
10. Calculate F-statistic as the ratio of MSB to MSW and combine all required metrics (sample count, group count, MSB, MSW, F) in final SELECT statement.
