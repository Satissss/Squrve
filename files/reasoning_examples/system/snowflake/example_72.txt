# [Question]: Calculate the chi-square value to assess the association between histological types and the presence of CDH1 gene mutations in BRCA patients using data from the PanCancer Atlas. Focus on patients with known histological types and consider only reliable mutation entries.  Exclude any histological types or mutation statuses with marginal totals less than or equal to 10. Match clinical and mutation data using ParticipantBarcode
# [Schema links]: ["CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED.histological_type", "CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED.bcr_patient_barcode", "CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED.acronym", "MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE.Hugo_Symbol", "MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE.ParticipantBarcode", "MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE.Study", "MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE.FILTER"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED` (histological_type, bcr_patient_barcode, acronym) and `MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE` (Hugo_Symbol, ParticipantBarcode, Study, FILTER).
2. Filter clinical data for BRCA patients with non-null histological_type and alias bcr_patient_barcode as ParticipantBarcode.
3. Filter mutation data for CDH1 mutations in BRCA studies with FILTER='PASS', grouping by ParticipantBarcode and Hugo_Symbol.
4. Create a summary table (summ_table) by joining clinical and mutation data on ParticipantBarcode, categorizing mutation presence as 'YES'/'NO', and counting Nij for each histological_type/mutation_status pair.
5. Calculate row (Ni) and column (Nj) totals from summ_table and retain only pairs where both totals exceed 10 via cross-joined Ni/Nj criteria.
6. Construct a contingency table by joining valid data pairs with observed Nij and computing expected counts (E_nij) using row/column/grand totals.
7. Calculate the chi-square statistic by summing (Nij - E_nij)^2 / E_nij across all valid cells in the contingency table.
