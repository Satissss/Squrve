# [Question]: What are the five longest types of highways within the multipolygon boundary of Denmark (as defined by Wikidata ID 'Q35') by total length, analyzed through planet features?
# [Schema links]: ['PLANET_FEATURES.all_tags', 'PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type', 'PLANET_FEATURES.geometry', 'PLANET_FEATURES.all_tags', 'PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type', 'PLANET_FEATURES.geometry']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to filter the planet_features table for the multipolygon boundary of Denmark using the Wikidata ID 'Q35' from the all_tags column.
2. Create a CTE named bounding_area to extract the geometry of the Denmark multipolygon by filtering feature_type='multipolygons' and matching the wikidata tag value 'Q35'.
3. Identify the need to analyze highway features within the Denmark boundary, which are stored as lines in the planet_features table with a highway tag in all_tags.
4. Create a CTE named highway_info to calculate the total length of each highway type within the Denmark boundary.
5. Join the planet_features table with the bounding_area CTE and use ST_DWITHIN to filter highway lines that are within the Denmark boundary geometry.
6. Use LATERAL FLATTEN on the all_tags column to extract the highway type from tags where key is 'highway'.
7. Calculate the total length of each highway type using ST_LENGTH on the geometry converted to geography.
8. Group the results by highway_type to get the sum of lengths for each type.
9. In the main query, select the highway_type and clean it by removing quotation marks using REPLACE.
10. Order the results by highway_length in descending order to get the longest types first.
11. Apply LIMIT 5 to return only the top five longest highway types.
