# [Question]: Which repository with an approved license in `licenses.md` had the highest combined total of forks, issues, and watches in April 2022?
# [Schema links]: [GITHUB_REPOS.LICENSES.repo_name, GITHUB_REPOS.LICENSES.license, MONTH._202204.repo, MONTH._202204.type, MONTH._202204.actor]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify repositories with approved licenses by filtering `GITHUB_REPOS.LICENSES` where `license` is in the specified list.
2. Extract fork events from `MONTH._202204` where `type` is 'ForkEvent' and count occurrences per repository.
3. Extract issue events from `MONTH._202204` where `type` is 'IssuesEvent' and count occurrences per repository.
4. Extract watch events from `MONTH._202204` where `type` is 'WatchEvent' and count distinct actors per repository.
5. Create CTEs for each event type (`fork_counts`, `issue_counts`, `watch_counts`) to aggregate counts by repository name.
6. Join the `allowed_repos` CTE with all three event count CTEs on repository name to ensure only repositories with all event types are considered.
7. Calculate the combined total of forks, issues, and watches for each repository.
8. Order the results by the combined total in descending order and select the top repository.
