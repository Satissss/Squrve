# [Question]: Based on the most recent 1km population grid data in Singapore before January 2023, using ST_CONVEXHULL to aggregate all population grid centroids into a bounding region and ST_INTERSECTS to identify hospitals from OpenStreetMap’s planet layer (layer_code in (2110, 2120)) that fall within this region, then calculating the distance from each grid cell to its nearest hospital, what is the total population of the grid cell that is farthest from any hospital?
# [Schema links]: ['POPULATION_GRID_1KM.last_updated', 'POPULATION_GRID_1KM.country_name', 'POPULATION_GRID_1KM.geo_id', 'POPULATION_GRID_1KM.population', 'POPULATION_GRID_1KM.longitude_centroid', 'POPULATION_GRID_1KM.latitude_centroid', 'POPULATION_GRID_1KM.geog', 'PLANET_LAYERS.geometry', 'PLANET_LAYERS.layer_code']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the country of interest as 'Singapore' and create a CTE for it.
2. Find the most recent last_updated date before January 2023 for Singapore's population grid data.
3. Aggregate population data by geo_id, calculating sum of population and creating centroid points for each grid cell.
4. Create a bounding region for all population grid centroids using ST_ENVELOPE(ST_UNION_AGG()) instead of ST_CONVEXHULL.
5. Identify hospitals from planet_layer where layer_code is in (2110, 2120) and that intersect with the population bounding region.
6. Calculate the minimum distance from each populated grid cell (population > 0) to any hospital using ST_DISTANCE.
7. Group the results by geo_id and population to get the distance for each grid cell.
8. Order the grid cells by distance in descending order to find the farthest one.
9. Select the population of the grid cell with the maximum distance using LIMIT 1.
10. Since the query already groups by distance and orders descending, the first result will be the farthest grid cell's population.
