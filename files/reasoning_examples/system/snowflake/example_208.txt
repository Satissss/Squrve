# [Question]: Calculate the average balance (in quadrillions, 10^15) of the top 10 Ethereum addresses by net balance, including incoming and outgoing transfers from traces (only successful transactions and excluding call types like delegatecall, callcode, and staticcall), miner rewards (sum of gas fees per block), and sender gas fee deductions. Exclude null addresses and round the result to two decimal places.
# [Schema links]: ['TRACES.to_address', 'TRACES.value', 'TRACES.status', 'TRACES.call_type', 'TRACES.from_address', 'TRANSACTIONS.miner', 'TRANSACTIONS.receipt_gas_used', 'TRANSACTIONS.gas_price', 'TRANSACTIONS.from_address', 'BLOCKS.number', 'TRANSACTIONS.block_number']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to calculate net balance for Ethereum addresses by considering multiple sources: incoming transfers (credits), outgoing transfers (debits), miner rewards, and gas fee deductions.
2. For traces (transfers), filter only successful transactions (status=1) and exclude specific call types (delegatecall, callcode, staticcall) or null call types.
3. Create a unified ledger (double_entry_book) using UNION ALL to combine all balance-affecting events:
   - Incoming transfers (to_address) as positive values.
   - Outgoing transfers (from_address) as negative values.
   - Miner rewards (sum of gas fees per block) as positive values to miner addresses.
   - Gas fee deductions from transaction senders (from_address) as negative values.
4. Join TRANSACTIONS with BLOCKS to associate miners with their rewards using block_number and number.
5. Aggregate the net balance for each address by summing all values in the double_entry_book.
6. Select the top 10 addresses by net balance in descending order.
7. Calculate the average balance of these top 10 addresses.
8. Convert the average balance to quadrillions (divide by 1e15) and round to two decimal places.
