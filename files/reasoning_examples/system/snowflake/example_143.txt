# [Question]: In the "qin_prostate_repeatability" collection, please provide the distinct StudyInstanceUIDs for studies that include T2-weighted axial MR imaging and also contain anatomical structure segmentations labeled as "Peripheral zone."
# [Schema links]: ["IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.StudyInstanceUID", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.Modality", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.collection_id", "IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.SOPInstanceUID", "IDC_V17.SEGMENTATIONS.SOPInstanceUID", "IDC_V17.SEGMENTATIONS.SegmentedPropertyType.CodeMeaning", "IDC_V17.SEGMENTATIONS.SegmentedPropertyCategory.CodeMeaning"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required tables: `IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL` for study and modality information, and `IDC_V17.SEGMENTATIONS` for segmentation labels.
2. Filter `DICOM_ALL` for MR studies in the "qin_prostate_repeatability" collection with "T2 Weighted Axial" in SeriesDescription to get eligible StudyInstanceUIDs.
3. Create a CTE `mr_studies` to store these MR study identifiers.
4. Join `DICOM_ALL` with `SEGMENTATIONS` on SOPInstanceUID to link segmentations to their studies.
5. Filter segmentations for "Peripheral zone" in `SegmentedPropertyType.CodeMeaning` and "Anatomical Structure" in `SegmentedPropertyCategory.CodeMeaning` within the same collection.
6. Create a CTE `seg_studies` to store StudyInstanceUIDs with valid segmentations.
7. Join `mr_studies` and `seg_studies` on StudyInstanceUID to find overlapping studies meeting both criteria.
8. Select distinct StudyInstanceUIDs from the joined result to ensure uniqueness.
