# [Question]: Using segment-level copy number data from the copy_number_segment_allelic_hg38_gdc_r23 dataset restricted to 'TCGA-KIRC' samples, merge these segments with the cytogenetic band definitions in 'CytoBands_hg38' to identify each sample’s maximum copy number per cytoband. Classify these maximum copy numbers into amplifications (>3), gains (=3), homozygous deletions (=0), heterozygous deletions (=1), or normal (=2), then calculate the frequency of each subtype out of the total number of distinct cases, and finally present these frequencies as percentages sorted by chromosome and cytoband.
# [Schema links]: ['COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23.case_barcode', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23.chromosome', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23.start_pos', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23.end_pos', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23.copy_number', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23.project_short_name', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38.chromosome', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38.cytoband_name', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38.hg38_start', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38.hg38_stop']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Filter the copy number data to only include samples from 'TCGA-KIRC' and aggregate to get the maximum copy number per segment for each case, chromosome, start, and end position.
2. Calculate the total number of distinct cases from the filtered copy number data for later frequency calculation.
3. Retrieve the cytoband definitions including chromosome, cytoband name, and genomic start/stop positions.
4. Merge the copy number segments with cytobands by chromosome, ensuring genomic overlap between segment and cytoband coordinates.
5. For each cytoband and case, determine the maximum copy number by aggregating over overlapping segments.
6. Classify the maximum copy numbers into amplification, gain, homozygous deletion, heterozygous deletion, or normal categories and count occurrences per cytoband.
7. Compute the frequency of each aberration type as a percentage of the total distinct cases.
8. Sort the final output by chromosome and cytoband name.
