# [Question]: Which primary programming languages, determined by the highest number of bytes in each repository, had at least 100 PullRequestEvents on January 18, 2023 across all their repositories?
# [Schema links]: ['_20230118.created_at', '_20230118.repo', 'LANGUAGES.repo_name', 'LANGUAGES.language']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `GITHUB_REPOS_DATE.DAY._20230118` for event data and `GITHUB_REPOS_DATE.GITHUB_REPOS.LANGUAGES` for repository language data.
2. Extract the repository name from the `repo` field in `_20230118` by removing URL prefixes using `REGEXP_REPLACE`.
3. Extract year and quarter from the `created_at` timestamp in `_20230118` for potential grouping, though the question specifies a single date (January 18, 2023).
4. For the `LANGUAGES` table, flatten the `language` array to access each language's `name` and `bytes` for each repository.
5. For each repository, determine the primary language by selecting the language with the highest `bytes` using `FIRST_VALUE` ordered by `bytes DESC`.
6. Filter out repositories where the primary language is null.
7. Join the event data with the repository language data on the repository name to associate each event with its primary language.
8. Filter the events to only include `PullRequestEvent` types and the specific date (January 18, 2023), though the date is implicit in the table name.
9. Group the joined data by language and event type to count the number of `PullRequestEvent` per primary language.
10. Filter the results to only include languages with at least 100 `PullRequestEvent` counts (though the SQL uses 5, the question requires 100; this is likely a discrepancy in the provided SQL).
11. Select the language name (cleaning any quotes) and the count of events.
