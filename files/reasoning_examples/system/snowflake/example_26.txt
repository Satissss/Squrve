# [Question]: Can you tell me which bike trip in New York City on July 15, 2015, started and ended in ZIP Code areas with the highest average temperature for that day, as recorded by the Central Park weather station '94728'? If there's more than one trip that meets these criteria, I'd like to know about the one that starts in the smallest ZIP Code and ends in the largest ZIP Code.
# [Schema links]: ["GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES.zip_code", "NEW_YORK_CITIBIKE.CITIBIKE_TRIPS.start_station_longitude", "NEW_YORK_CITIBIKE.CITIBIKE_TRIPS.start_station_latitude", "NEW_YORK_CITIBIKE.CITIBIKE_TRIPS.end_station_longitude", "NEW_YORK_CITIBIKE.CITIBIKE_TRIPS.end_station_latitude", "NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2015.year", "NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2015.mo", "NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2015.da", "NEW_YORK_CITIBIKE.CITIBIKE_TRIPS.starttime", "NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2015.wban", "NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2015.temp"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` (start/end station coordinates, starttime), `ZIP_CODES` (geometries for ZIP codes), and `GSOD2015` (temperature data for weather station '94728').
2. Join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `ZIP_CODES` twice to map start and end stations to their respective ZIP codes using spatial functions like `ST_WITHIN` and `ST_POINT`.
3. Join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `GSOD2015` to link trip dates with temperature data, ensuring the date matches July 15, 2015, and the weather station is '94728'.
4. Filter trips to those occurring on July 15, 2015, and recorded at the specified weather station.
5. Order results by temperature (descending) to prioritize the highest temperature, then by start ZIP (ascending) and end ZIP (descending) to resolve ties.
6. Select the top record using `LIMIT 1` to get the desired trip.
