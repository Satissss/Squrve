# [Question]: Based on the most recent 1km population grid data in Singapore before January 2023, using ST_CONVEXHULL to aggregate all population grid centroids into a bounding region and ST_INTERSECTS to identify hospitals from OpenStreetMap’s planet layer (layer_code in (2110, 2120)) that fall within this region, then calculating the distance from each grid cell to its nearest hospital, what is the total population of the grid cell that is farthest from any hospital?
# [Schema links]: ["POPULATION_GRID_1KM.last_updated", "POPULATION_GRID_1KM.country_name", "POPULATION_GRID_1KM.geo_id", "POPULATION_GRID_1KM.population", "POPULATION_GRID_1KM.longitude_centroid", "POPULATION_GRID_1KM.latitude_centroid", "POPULATION_GRID_1KM.geog", "PLANET_LAYERS.geometry", "PLANET_LAYERS.layer_code"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `POPULATION_GRID_1KM` (last_updated, country_name, geo_id, population, longitude_centroid, latitude_centroid, geog) and `PLANET_LAYERS` (geometry, layer_code).
2. Filter `POPULATION_GRID_1KM` for Singapore data with the latest `last_updated` before January 2023.
3. Calculate the centroid for each grid cell using `ST_POINT(longitude_centroid, latitude_centroid)`.
4. Aggregate population by `geo_id` and create a bounding region using `ST_ENVELOPE(ST_UNION_AGG(centr))` to define the spatial extent of all grid centroids.
5. Extract hospitals from `PLANET_LAYERS` where `layer_code` is 2110 or 2120 and their geometry intersects with the bounding region.
6. Compute the minimum distance from each grid cell's `geog` to the nearest hospital's geometry using `ST_DISTANCE`.
7. Group the distance calculations by grid cell and select the grid with the maximum distance value.
8. Sum the population of the grid cell(s) with the maximum distance to hospitals.
