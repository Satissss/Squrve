# [Question]: Can you list the top 5 months from August 2022 to November 2023 where the profit from Facebook-sourced completed orders showed the largest month-over-month increase? Calculate profit as sales minus costs.
# [Schema links]: ["ORDERS.order_id", "ORDERS.user_id", "ORDERS.created_at", "ORDERS.delivered_at", "ORDERS.status", "ORDER_ITEMS.order_id", "ORDER_ITEMS.product_id", "ORDER_ITEMS.sale_price", "PRODUCTS.id", "PRODUCTS.cost", "USERS.id", "USERS.traffic_source"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify required tables and columns: ORDERS (order_id, user_id, created_at, delivered_at, status), ORDER_ITEMS (order_id, product_id, sale_price), PRODUCTS (id, cost), USERS (id, traffic_source).
2. Filter orders to include only completed orders from Facebook users with created_at between August 2022 and November 2023.
3. Convert delivered_at to a monthly timestamp and calculate delivery_month for grouping.
4. Join ORDERS with ORDER_ITEMS, PRODUCTS, and USERS to combine sale_price, cost, and traffic_source information.
5. Calculate total_profit as (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cost)) grouped by delivery_month and traffic_source.
6. Create a self-join between monthly_sales to compare current and previous month's profit values.
7. Calculate month-over-month profit increase using current_month.total_profit - previous_month.total_profit.
8. Filter results to include only months from August 2022 onward while retaining July for calculation.
9. Sort months by profit increase in descending order and select top 5.
