# [Question]: Identify the top five patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2` that are most similar to it based on technological similarities. Please provide the publication numbers.
# [Schema links]: ["PUBLICATIONS.publication_number", "PUBLICATIONS.application_number", "PUBLICATIONS.filing_date", "ABS_AND_EMB.publication_number", "ABS_AND_EMB.embedding_v1"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Retrieve the filing year of the target patent 'US-9741766-B2' from the PUBLICATIONS table by converting its filing_date to a year.
2. Identify all patents filed in the same year as the target patent excluding itself using the filing_date conversion.
3. Extract embeddings from ABS_AND_EMB.embedding_v1 for both the target patent and the filtered patents.
4. Flatten the embedding arrays into individual elements with their positions for dot product calculation.
5. Calculate the dot product similarity between the target patent's embedding and each comparable patent's embedding by aligning vector positions.
6. Aggregate the summed dot products to compute total similarity scores between patents.
7. Rank patents by their similarity scores in descending order partitioned by the target patent.
8. Select the top 5 patents with the highest similarity scores using row_number() ranking.
