# [Question]: In which year did the assignee with the most applications in the patent category 'A61' file the most?
# [Schema links]: ['PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.assignee_harmonized', 'PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.filing_date', 'PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.application_number', 'PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS.cpc']
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify relevant columns: `assignee_harmonized`, `filing_date`, `application_number`, and `cpc` from `PATENTS.PUBLICATIONS`.
2. Filter patents by CPC category 'A61' using `WHERE c.value:"code" LIKE 'A61%'` after expanding `cpc` with `LATERAL FLATTEN`.
3. Normalize assignee and filing data per application using `FIRST_VALUE` to deduplicate assignee and filing_date per `application_number`.
4. Group by `application_number` to ensure each application is counted once, selecting any assignee and filing date.
5. Expand `assignee_harmonized` into individual assignees using `LATERAL FLATTEN` and calculate total applications per assignee per year.
6. Determine the assignee with the highest total applications across all years using `SUM(total_applications)` and `LIMIT 1`.
7. Join the top assignee's data to find their yearly application counts and select the year with the highest count using `ORDER BY total_applications DESC LIMIT 1`.
8. Extract the `filing_year` from the final result to answer the question.
