# [Question]: For each customer and each month of 2020, first calculate the month-end balance by adding all deposit amounts and subtracting all withdrawal amounts that occurred during that specific month. Then determine which month in 2020 has the highest count of customers with a positive month-end balance and which month has the lowest count. For each of these two months, compute the average month-end balance across all customers and provide the difference between these two averages

# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to generate all months of 2020 for each customer to ensure every customer-month combination is represented, even if no transactions occurred.
2. Use a recursive CTE (`generate_series`) to generate numbers 0 to 11 representing each month offset from January 2020.
3. Create a CTE (`generate_months_cte`) that cross joins customers with the generated months to produce all customer-month combinations for 2020.
4. Calculate the net transaction amount per customer per month by summing deposits as positive and withdrawals as negative amounts in a CTE (`closing_balance`).
5. Join the generated months CTE with the closing balance CTE to compute the month-end balance for each customer-month, defaulting to 0 if no transactions occurred.
6. Create a CTE (`positive_balance_counts`) to count the number of customers with a positive month-end balance for each month.
7. Identify the month with the highest count of positive balances (`most_positive_month`) and the month with the lowest count (`least_positive_month`).
8. Compute the average month-end balance for the most positive month and the least positive month in a CTE (`average_balance`).
9. Calculate the difference between the two average balances in the final SELECT statement.
