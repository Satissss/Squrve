# [Question]: What are the RNA expression levels of the genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1, along with associated clinical information, in bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project?  Use clinical data from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, data about somatic mutations derived from the hg19 human genome reference in Feb 2017.

# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to find bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the TCGA-BLCA project from the somatic mutation table.
2. Query the SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_DCC_2017_02 table for cases where Hugo_Symbol is 'CDKN2A' and project_short_name is 'TCGA-BLCA', selecting case_barcode and Variant_Type.
3. Group the results by case_barcode and Variant_Type to avoid duplicates.
4. Join these results with the CLINICAL_GDC_R39 table using case_barcode = submitter_id to get clinical information (gender, vital_status, days_to_death).
5. Create a subquery (clinical_info) that combines the mutation cases with their clinical data.
6. Join this clinical_info subquery with the RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02 table on case_barcode to get RNA expression data.
7. Filter the RNA expression results to only include genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1 using HGNC_gene_symbol IN.
8. Select the required columns: case_barcode, sample_barcode, aliquot_barcode, HGNC_gene_symbol, Variant_Type, gene_id, normalized_count, project_short_name, and the clinical columns.
9. Order the final results by case_barcode and HGNC_gene_symbol for organized output.
