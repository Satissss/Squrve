# [Question]: Which Ethereum address has the top 3 smallest positive balance from transactions involving the token at address "0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"?
# [Schema links]: ['TOKEN_TRANSFERS.token_address', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS.from_address', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS.to_address', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS.value']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Filter the TOKEN_TRANSFERS table to include only transactions where token_address is '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'.
2. Create a CTE (transaction_addresses) to extract from_address, to_address, and convert value to numeric format (dividing by 1000000 to handle decimal precision).
3. Create a CTE (out_addresses) to calculate outgoing transactions: for each from_address, sum the negative values (representing outflows).
4. Create a CTE (in_addresses) to calculate incoming transactions: for each to_address, sum the positive values (representing inflows).
5. Create a CTE (all_addresses) that combines both outgoing and incoming transactions using UNION ALL, with address and total_value columns.
6. Group all_addresses by address and calculate the net balance by summing total_value for each address.
7. Filter addresses to only include those with positive net balance (SUM(total_value) > 0).
8. Order the results by net balance in ascending order to get the smallest positive balances first.
9. Limit the output to the top 3 smallest positive balances.
