# [Question]: Could you provide a clean, structured dataset from dicom_all table that only includes SM images marked as VOLUME from the TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC collections, excluding any slides with compression type “other,” where the specimen preparation step explicitly has “Embedding medium” set to “Tissue freezing medium,” and ensuring that the tissue type is only “normal” or “tumor” and the cancer subtype is reported accordingly?
# [Schema links]: ['DICOM_ALL.SeriesInstanceUID', 'DICOM_ALL.StudyInstanceUID', 'DICOM_ALL.ContainerIdentifier', 'DICOM_ALL.PatientID', 'DICOM_ALL.TotalPixelMatrixColumns', 'DICOM_ALL.TotalPixelMatrixRows', 'DICOM_ALL.collection_id', 'DICOM_ALL.crdc_instance_uuid', 'DICOM_ALL.gcs_url', 'DICOM_ALL.SharedFunctionalGroupsSequence', 'DICOM_ALL.TransferSyntaxUID', 'DICOM_ALL.Modality', 'DICOM_ALL.ImageType', 'DICOM_ALL.SpecimenDescriptionSequence', 'DICOM_ALL.SpecimenDescriptionSequence']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to filter for SM modality images with VOLUME in ImageType from the DICOM_ALL table.
2. Extract key columns for the output dataset including SeriesInstanceUID, StudyInstanceUID, ContainerIdentifier, PatientID, TotalPixelMatrixColumns, TotalPixelMatrixRows, collection_id, crdc_instance_uuid, gcs_url, and compute pixel spacing from SharedFunctionalGroupsSequence.
3. Determine compression type by mapping TransferSyntaxUID values to 'jpeg', 'jpeg2000', or 'other'.
4. Create a CTE (sm_images) to handle the initial filtering and column selection for SM VOLUME images.
5. Extract tissue types by flattening SpecimenDescriptionSequence and PrimaryAnatomicStructureSequence, mapping CodeValue to 'normal', 'tumor', or 'other'.
6. Create a CTE (tissue_types) to store distinct digital_slide_id and tissue_type values.
7. Extract specimen preparation details by flattening SpecimenDescriptionSequence and SpecimenPreparationSequence to get item_name and item_value.
8. Create a CTE (specimen_preparation_sequence_items) to store distinct digital_slide_id, item_name, and item_value.
9. Join the sm_images CTE with tissue_types and specimen_preparation_sequence_items CTEs on digital_slide_id.
10. Filter for collections 'tcga_luad' or 'tcga_lusc'.
11. Exclude compression type 'other'.
12. Filter tissue_type to only 'normal' or 'tumor'.
13. Filter for specimens where item_name is 'Embedding medium' and item_value is 'Tissue freezing medium'.
14. Replace collection_id values 'tcga_luad' with 'luad' and 'tcga_lusc' with 'lscc' to form cancer_subtype.
15. Order the final results by crdc_instance_uuid.
