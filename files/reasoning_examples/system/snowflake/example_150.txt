# [Question]: In the dicom_pivot table, how many unique StudyInstanceUID values exactly match the SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence of "15825003" (case-insensitive) and also have a collection_id of either "Community" or "nsclc_radiomics"?
# [Schema links]: ["IDC_V17.DICOM_PIVOT.StudyInstanceUID"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `IDC_V17.DICOM_PIVOT` with columns `StudyInstanceUID`, `SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence`, and `collection_id`.
2. Filter rows where `SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence` matches '15825003' case-insensitively using `LOWER()`.
3. Group the filtered rows by `StudyInstanceUID` to get unique values for the first condition.
4. Filter rows where `collection_id` is either 'Community' or 'nsclc_radiomics'.
5. Group the filtered rows by `StudyInstanceUID` to get unique values for the second condition.
6. Use `INTERSECT` to find `StudyInstanceUID` values common to both grouped result sets.
7. Count the number of unique `StudyInstanceUID` values from the intersected result using `COUNT(*)`.
8. Construct the final SQL by nesting subqueries to apply the conditions and aggregation.
