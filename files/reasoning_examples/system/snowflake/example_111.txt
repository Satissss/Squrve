# [Question]: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.
# [Schema links]: ["standard_tile.history_day.country", "standard_tile.history_day.postal_code", "standard_tile.history_day.tot_snowfall_in"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant columns: `country`, `postal_code`, `date_valid_std`, and `tot_snowfall_in` from the `history_day` table.
2. Calculate the reference timestamp as the start of the previous year using `DATE_TRUNC` and `DATEADD`.
3. Determine the end date of the week two weeks into the previous year, adjusted for ISO week alignment.
4. Generate all seven days of the target week by calculating dates relative to the end date using a subquery with `ROW_NUMBER()`.
5. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `timestamps` to store the generated dates for the target week.
6. Join the `history_day` table with the `timestamps` CTE on `date_valid_std` to filter records to the target week.
7. Filter the joined results to include only U.S. postal codes (`country = 'US'`) and snowfall amounts exceeding 6 inches (`tot_snowfall_in > 6.0`).
8. Select the required columns (`country`, `postal_code`, `date_valid_std`, `tot_snowfall_in`) and order the results by `postal_code` and `date_valid_std`.
