# [Question]: Which OpenStreetMap ID from the planet features table corresponds to an administrative boundary, represented as multipolygons, whose total number of 'amenity'-tagged Points of Interest (POIs), as derived from the planet nodes table, is closest to the median count among all such boundaries?
# [Schema links]: ["PLANET_FEATURES.osm_id", "PLANET_FEATURES.geometry", "PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type", "PLANET_NODES.id", "PLANET_NODES.geometry"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify administrative boundaries by filtering PLANET_FEATURES where feature_type is 'multipolygons' and tags include 'boundary'='administrative'.
2. Extract all 'amenity'-tagged nodes from PLANET_NODES using LATERAL FLATTEN to process tag arrays.
3. Calculate the total amenity POIs within each administrative boundary using ST_DWITHIN to check spatial containment.
4. Compute the median of the total_pois values across all administrative boundaries.
5. Determine the difference between each boundary's total_pois and the median value.
6. Select the osm_id with the smallest difference from the median using ORDER BY and LIMIT 1.
