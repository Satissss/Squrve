# [Question]: I want to analyze bike trips in New York City for 2014 by linking trip data with weather information to understand how weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, and precipitation) affect bike trips between neighborhoods. For each combination of starting and ending neighborhoods, I need the following: 1. Total number of bike trips between the neighborhoods. 2. Average trip duration in minutes (rounded to 1 decimal). 3. Average temperature at the start of the trip (rounded to 1 decimal). 4. Average wind speed at the start (in meters per second, rounded to 1 decimal). 5. Average precipitation at the start (in centimeters, rounded to 1 decimal). 6. The month with the most trips (e.g., `4` for April). The data should be grouped by the starting and ending neighborhoods, with:`zip_codes` in `geo_us_boundaries` used to map the bike trip locations based on latitude and longitude. `zip_codes` in `cyclistic` used to obtain the borough and neighborhood names. Using weather data from the Central Park station for the trip date, covering all trips in 2014.

# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify required tables and columns: `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` (tripduration, start/end coordinates, starttime), `ZIP_CODES` (neighborhood, borough via geospatial join), `GSOD2014` (weather metrics), and `STATIONS` (to filter Central Park station).
2. Join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES` twice to map start/end stations to zip codes using spatial ST_WITHIN function on coordinates.
3. Join to `CYCLISTIC.ZIP_CODES` to get neighborhood/borough names via zip code matches.
4. Join weather data (`GSOD2014`) by matching trip date (converted from starttime) with NOAA's year/mo/da fields.
5. Filter weather data to Central Park station using WBAN code from STATIONS table.
6. Convert trip duration to minutes and format weather metrics with rounding.
7. Create CTE `data` to store pre-joined and formatted data for 2014 trips.
8. Aggregate `data` into `agg_data` calculating trip counts, average trip duration, and weather averages grouped by start/end neighborhoods.
9. Create `most_common_months` CTE to rank months by trip count per neighborhood pair and select top month.
10. Join `agg_data` with `most_common_months` to attach the top month value.
11. Select final columns combining aggregated metrics and most common month, ordered by neighborhoods.
