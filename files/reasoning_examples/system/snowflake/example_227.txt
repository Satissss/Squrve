# [Question]: Retrieve the following information for U.S. patents filed between January 1, 2014, and February 1, 2014. The patent title and abstract. The publication date of the patent. The number of backward citations for each patent (i.e., the number of patents cited by the current patent before its filing date). The number of forward citations for each patent within the first 5 years of its publication (i.e., the number of patents that cited the current patent within 5 years after its publication). For each patent, ensure the forward citations are counted only for citations within 5 years after the publication date, and backward citations are counted for citations before the filing date.
# [Schema links]: ['PATENT.title', 'PATENT.abstract', 'APPLICATION.date', 'APPLICATION.patent_id', 'CPC_CURRENT.patent_id', 'CPC_CURRENT.subsection_id', 'CPC_CURRENT.group_id', 'USPATENTCITATION.citation_id', 'USPATENTCITATION.date', 'USPATENTCITATION.patent_id', 'APPLICATION.country', 'APPLICATION.date']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required output columns: patent title, abstract, publication date, backward citations count, and forward citations count within 5 years.
2. Determine the relevant tables: PATENT (for title and abstract), APPLICATION (for publication date and country), USPATENTCITATION (for citation data), and CPC_CURRENT (for filtering patents).
3. Filter patents by application date range (January 1, 2014, to February 1, 2014) and country (US) using the APPLICATION table.
4. Calculate backward citations: For each patent, count citations in USPATENTCITATION where the citation date is before the patent's filing date (using APPLICATION.date).
5. Calculate forward citations within 5 years: For each patent, count citations in USPATENTCITATION where the citation date is within 5 years after the patent's publication date (using APPLICATION.date).
6. Use subqueries to compute backward and forward citation counts separately, then join them on patent_id.
7. Handle potential NULL values in citation counts using IFNULL to set them to 0.
8. Filter patents using CPC_CURRENT based on specific subsection_id and group_id values to narrow down the patent set.
9. Join the PATENT, APPLICATION, and filtered citation data (from the subquery) to assemble the final result.
10. Apply the date range filter in the WHERE clause to restrict results to the specified period.
