# [Question]: From January 1, 2019, to April 30, 2022, how many users are at the youngest age and how many users are at the oldest age for each gender in the e-commerce platform, counting both youngest and oldest users separately for each gender?
# [Schema links]: ['USERS.created_at', 'USERS.first_name', 'USERS.last_name', 'USERS.gender', 'USERS.age']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Filter the USERS table to include only those records where the created_at date falls between '2019-01-01' and '2022-04-30', converting the timestamp format appropriately.
2. Create a CTE (filtered_users) to store the filtered user data with relevant columns: first_name, last_name, gender, age, and the converted created_at date.
3. Create a CTE (youngest_ages) to find the minimum age for each gender from the filtered_users.
4. Create a CTE (oldest_ages) to find the maximum age for each gender from the filtered_users.
5. Create a CTE (youngest_oldest) that combines the youngest and oldest users for each gender by joining filtered_users with youngest_ages and oldest_ages, and assign a 'tag' to identify youngest and oldest.
6. Count the number of users for each combination of tag and gender from the youngest_oldest CTE.
7. Order the final results by tag and gender for clear presentation.
