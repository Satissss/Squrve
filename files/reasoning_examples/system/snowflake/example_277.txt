# [Question]: In the "qin_prostate_repeatability" collection, please provide the distinct StudyInstanceUIDs for studies that include T2-weighted axial MR imaging and also contain anatomical structure segmentations labeled as "Peripheral zone."
# [Schema links]: ['DICOM_ALL.StudyInstanceUID', 'DICOM_ALL.Modality', 'DICOM_ALL.collection_id', 'DICOM_ALL.SeriesDescription', 'DICOM_ALL.SOPInstanceUID', 'SEGMENTATIONS.SOPInstanceUID', 'SEGMENTATIONS.SegmentedPropertyType', 'SEGMENTATIONS.SegmentedPropertyCategory']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the target collection: "qin_prostate_repeatability" in the DICOM_ALL table.
2. Filter for MR studies with T2-weighted axial imaging by checking Modality = 'MR' and SeriesDescription containing 'T2 Weighted Axial'.
3. Create a CTE (mr_studies) to select StudyInstanceUIDs that meet these MR criteria.
4. Identify studies containing segmentations labeled "Peripheral zone" by joining DICOM_ALL with SEGMENTATIONS on SOPInstanceUID.
5. Filter segmentations where SegmentedPropertyType contains 'Peripheral zone' and SegmentedPropertyCategory equals 'Anatomical Structure'.
6. Create a second CTE (seg_studies) to select StudyInstanceUIDs that meet these segmentation criteria.
7. Join the two CTEs (mr_studies and seg_studies) on StudyInstanceUID to find studies that satisfy both conditions.
8. Select distinct StudyInstanceUID from the joined result to eliminate duplicates.
