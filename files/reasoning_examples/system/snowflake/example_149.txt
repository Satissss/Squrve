# [Question]: Could you provide a clean, structured dataset from dicom_all table that only includes SM images marked as VOLUME from the TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC collections, excluding any slides with compression type “other,” where the specimen preparation step explicitly has “Embedding medium” set to “Tissue freezing medium,” and ensuring that the tissue type is only “normal” or “tumor” and the cancer subtype is reported accordingly?
# [Schema links]: [IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.SeriesInstanceUID, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.StudyInstanceUID, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.ContainerIdentifier, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.PatientID, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.TotalPixelMatrixColumns, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.TotalPixelMatrixRows, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.collection_id, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.crdc_instance_uuid, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.gcs_url, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.SharedFunctionalGroupsSequence, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.TransferSyntaxUID, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.Modality, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.ImageType, IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL.SpecimenDescriptionSequence]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the required columns from `IDC_V17.DICOM_ALL` including `SeriesInstanceUID`, `StudyInstanceUID`, `ContainerIdentifier`, `PatientID`, `TotalPixelMatrixColumns`, `TotalPixelMatrixRows`, `collection_id`, `crdc_instance_uuid`, `gcs_url`, and `SharedFunctionalGroupsSequence`.
2. Filter records where `Modality` is 'SM' and third element of `ImageType` array is 'VOLUME' to select SM volume images.
3. Extract compression type based on `TransferSyntaxUID`, categorizing as 'jpeg', 'jpeg2000', or 'other', then exclude rows with compression 'other'.
4. Extract tissue type using `SpecimenDescriptionSequence` by mapping '17621005' to 'normal' and '86049000' to 'tumor' from nested `PrimaryAnatomicStructureModifierSequence`.
5. Extract specimen preparation details by unnesting `SpecimenPreparationSequence` to find entries where `item_name` is 'Embedding medium' and `item_value` is 'Tissue freezing medium'.
6. Join the filtered SM images with tissue types and specimen preparation details on `SeriesInstanceUID` to combine necessary attributes.
7. Apply collection filters to include only 'tcga_luad' and 'tcga_lusc' collections.
8. Enforce tissue type restriction to only 'normal' or 'tumor' and ensure embedding medium condition is met.
9. Transform `collection_id` values to 'luad'/'lscc' for cancer subtype and select final columns with required aliases.
10. Order results by `crdc_instance_uuid` to ensure consistent output structure.
