# [Question]: Calculate the total circulating supply of 'BNB' tokens (in units divided by 10^18) by summing balances of all non-zero addresses, where each address’s balance equals its total received BNB minus sent BNB. Exclude transactions involving the zero address (0x000...) for both senders and receivers.

# [Analysis]: # Output: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the token 'BNB' in the TOKENS table to get its contract address.
2. Filter TOKEN_TRANSFERS for transactions involving the BNB token address.
3. Calculate the total received BNB (in units divided by 10^18) for each non-zero to_address, excluding the zero address.
4. Calculate the total sent BNB (in units divided by 10^18) for each non-zero from_address, excluding the zero address.
5. For each address, compute the balance as total received minus total sent.
6. Sum the balances of all addresses to get the total circulating supply.
