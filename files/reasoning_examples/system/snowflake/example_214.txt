# [Question]: I want to analyze bike trips in New York City for 2014 by linking trip data with weather information to understand how weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, and precipitation) affect bike trips between neighborhoods. For each combination of starting and ending neighborhoods, I need the following: 1. Total number of bike trips between the neighborhoods. 2. Average trip duration in minutes (rounded to 1 decimal). 3. Average temperature at the start of the trip (rounded to 1 decimal). 4. Average wind speed at the start (in meters per second, rounded to 1 decimal). 5. Average precipitation at the start (in centimeters, rounded to 1 decimal). 6. The month with the most trips (e.g., `4` for April). The data should be grouped by the starting and ending neighborhoods, with:`zip_codes` in `geo_us_boundaries` used to map the bike trip locations based on latitude and longitude. `zip_codes` in `cyclistic` used to obtain the borough and neighborhood names. Using weather data from the Central Park station for the trip date, covering all trips in 2014.
# [Schema links]: ['CITIBIKE_TRIPS.tripduration', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.start_station_longitude', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.start_station_latitude', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.end_station_longitude', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.end_station_latitude', 'CITIBIKE_TRIPS.starttime', 'ZIP_CODES.zip_code_geom', 'GSOD2014.temp', 'GSOD2014.wdsp', 'GSOD2014.prcp', 'GSOD2014.year', 'GSOD2014.mo', 'GSOD2014.da', 'STATIONS.wban', 'STATIONS.state', 'STATIONS.name', 'ZIP_CODES.zip', 'ZIP_CODES.zip_code']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the necessary tables: `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` for trip data, `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES` for geographic mapping, `CYCLISTIC.ZIP_CODES` for neighborhood names, `NOAA_GSOD.GSOD2014` for weather data, and `NOAA_GSOD.STATIONS` to filter for Central Park weather station.
2. Join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES` twice (as `ZIPSTART` and `ZIPEND`) using spatial functions (`ST_WITHIN` and `ST_POINT`) to map start and end station coordinates to zip codes.
3. Join the resulting zip codes with `CYCLISTIC.ZIP_CODES` twice (as `ZIPSTARTNAME` and `ZIPENDNAME`) to get borough and neighborhood names for both start and end locations.
4. Join `CITIBIKE_TRIPS` with `GSOD2014` on the trip start date (converting `GSOD2014` date fields to a proper date format) to get weather data.
5. Filter the weather data to only include records from the Central Park station (using a subquery to get its `wban`) and limit trips to those starting in 2014.
6. In the CTE `data`, calculate trip duration in minutes, extract the start month, and select relevant weather fields.
7. In the CTE `agg_data`, group by start and end borough and neighborhood to compute the count of trips and averages (rounded to 1 decimal) for trip duration, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.
8. In the CTE `most_common_months`, for each neighborhood pair, determine the month with the most trips using `ROW_NUMBER` over a partition ordered by trip count descending.
9. Join `agg_data` with `most_common_months` on the neighborhood pairs, filtering for the top-ranked month (`row_num = 1`).
10. Select all columns from `agg_data` and add the `most_common_month` from the join, ordering the final result by start and end neighborhood.
