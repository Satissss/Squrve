# [Question]: From January 1, 2019, to April 30, 2022, how many users are at the youngest age and how many users are at the oldest age for each gender in the e-commerce platform, counting both youngest and oldest users separately for each gender?
# [Schema links]: ["THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.first_name", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.last_name", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.gender", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.age", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.created_at"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `USERS` (first_name, last_name, gender, age, created_at).
2. Filter users created between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, by converting `created_at` to a date and applying the date range.
3. Calculate the minimum age (youngest) and maximum age (oldest) for each gender in the filtered user dataset.
4. Create a CTE `youngest_ages` to store the minimum age per gender and `oldest_ages` for maximum age per gender.
5. Join the filtered users with `youngest_ages` on matching gender and age to identify youngest users, and similarly join with `oldest_ages` for oldest users.
6. Combine the youngest and oldest user records using `UNION ALL` with a `tag` column to distinguish between the two groups.
7. Count the number of users in each `tag` (youngest/oldest) category per gender by grouping the combined results.
8. Order the final output by `tag` and `gender` to present the counts clearly.
