# [Question]: For each publication family whose earliest publication was first published in January 2015, please provide the earliest publication date, the distinct publication numbers, their country codes, the distinct CPC and IPC codes, distinct families (namely, the ids) that cite and are cited by this publication family. Please present all lists as comma-separated values, sorted alphabetically
# [Schema links]: ['PUBLICATIONS.family_id', 'PUBLICATIONS.publication_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.publication_date', 'PUBLICATIONS.country_code', 'PUBLICATIONS.cpc', 'PUBLICATIONS.ipc', 'PUBLICATIONS.citation', 'ABS_AND_EMB.cited_by']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to filter publication families by their earliest publication date being in January 2015.
2. Create a CTE `fam` to get all distinct family_ids from the PUBLICATIONS table.
3. Create a CTE `crossover` to map publication numbers to their family_ids for later joins.
4. Create a CTE `pub` to aggregate publication details per family: find the minimum publication_date, and use LISTAGG to create comma-separated lists of publication_numbers and country_codes, sorted alphabetically.
5. Create a CTE `tech_class` to handle the nested CPC and IPC codes: flatten the arrays, extract the code values, and use LISTAGG with DISTINCT to create sorted, comma-separated lists per family.
6. Create a CTE `cit` to handle citations: flatten the citation array, join with `crossover` to get the family_id of the cited publication, and aggregate into a sorted, comma-separated list.
7. Create a CTE `tmp_gpr` to handle the initial step for cited_by: flatten the cited_by array from ABS_AND_EMB, join with `crossover` to get the publication_number, and aggregate into a comma-separated list (not yet sorted by family_id).
8. Create a CTE `gpr` to process the tmp_gpr output: split the aggregated publication_numbers, join with `crossover` to get the corresponding family_id, and aggregate into a sorted, comma-separated list of family_ids.
9. Join all CTEs (`pub`, `tech_class`, `cit`, `gpr`) with the base `fam` CTE using left joins on family_id.
10. Filter the final result to only include families where the earliest publication date (from `pub`) is between 20150101 and 20150131.
