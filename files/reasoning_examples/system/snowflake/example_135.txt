# [Question]: Please create a month-by-month report for the year 2023 that focuses on the 'Sleep & Lounge' category, showing for each month the total sales, total cost, number of complete orders, total profit, and the profit-to-cost ratio, ensuring that the order is marked as 'Complete,' the creation date is between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, and the cost data is accurately associated with the corresponding product through the order items.
# [Schema links]: ["THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDERS.order_id", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDERS.created_at", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS.product_id", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDER_ITEMS.sale_price", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS.category", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS.cost", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.PRODUCTS.id", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.ORDERS.status"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the required tables and columns: ORDERS (order_id, created_at, status), ORDER_ITEMS (product_id, sale_price), PRODUCTS (category, cost, id).
2. Join ORDERS with ORDER_ITEMS on order_id and ORDER_ITEMS with PRODUCTS on product_id to link order details with product cost and category.
3. Filter records where status = 'Complete', created_at is within 2023, and category = 'Sleep & Lounge'.
4. Convert created_at timestamp (stored as epoch in milliseconds) to a formatted 'YYYY-MM' string for monthly grouping.
5. Create CTE 'd' to include month, sale_price, cost, and relevant identifiers after joins and filtering.
6. In CTE 'e', calculate aggregates for each month: SUM(sale_price) as TPV, SUM(cost) as total_cost, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as TPO, SUM(sale_price - cost) as total_profit.
7. Compute profit-to-cost ratio using SUM((sale_price - cost)/cost) OVER partitioned by month and category.
8. Select distinct monthly records with calculated aggregates from CTE 'e', ordered by month.
