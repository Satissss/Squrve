# [Question]: Among all repositories that do not use any programming language whose name (case-insensitively) includes the substring "python," what is the proportion of files whose paths include "readme.md" and whose contents contain the phrase "Copyright (c)"?
# [Schema links]: ['SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.content', 'SAMPLE_FILES.id', 'SAMPLE_FILES.repo_name', 'SAMPLE_FILES.path', 'LANGUAGES.repo_name', 'LANGUAGES.language']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify repositories that do not use any programming language with "python" (case-insensitive) in the name by querying the LANGUAGES table and filtering with `LOWER(language_name) NOT LIKE '%python%'`.
2. Use LATERAL FLATTEN on the "language" column in LANGUAGES to handle the array structure and extract language names.
3. Join the filtered LANGUAGES results with SAMPLE_FILES on repo_name to get files from those repositories.
4. Further filter SAMPLE_FILES to only include files where the path contains "readme.md" (case-insensitive) using `LOWER(path) LIKE '%readme.md'`.
5. Join the resulting files with SAMPLE_CONTENTS on id to get the content of each file.
6. Create a CTE named "requests" to store the combined data of id, content, repo_name, and path for all relevant files.
7. Calculate the proportion by counting all files in the CTE and counting files where content contains "Copyright (c)".
8. Divide the count of files with "Copyright (c)" by the total count of files to get the final proportion.
