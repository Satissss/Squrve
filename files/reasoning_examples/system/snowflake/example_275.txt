# [Question]: List the repository names and commit counts for the top two GitHub repositories with JavaScript as the primary language and the highest number of commits.
# [Schema links]: ['LANGUAGES.repo_name', 'LANGUAGES.language', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS.repo_name', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS.commit']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to find repositories where the primary language is JavaScript, which requires analyzing the LANGUAGES table to determine the dominant language per repository.
2. Flatten the LANGUAGES table to extract individual language names and their byte counts for each repository.
3. Use a subquery (t1) to select repo_name, language name (from the flattened array), and language bytes.
4. Apply RANK() window function partitioned by repo_name and ordered by language_bytes descending to assign a rank to each language within its repository, where rank 1 indicates the primary language.
5. Filter the results to keep only the primary language (rank = 1) for each repository, storing this in a CTE named 'repositories'.
6. Filter the 'repositories' CTE to select only those repositories where the primary language is 'JavaScript', storing this in a CTE named 'python_repo' (note: despite the name, it filters for JavaScript).
7. Join the SAMPLE_COMMITS table with the 'python_repo' CTE on repo_name to get commits only for JavaScript primary repositories.
8. Group the results by repo_name and count the number of commits for each repository.
9. Order the results by the commit count in descending order to prioritize repositories with the highest commits.
10. Limit the output to the top 2 repositories with the highest commit counts.
