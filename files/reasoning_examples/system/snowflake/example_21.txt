# [Question]: Could you please find the name of the repository that contains the most copied non-binary Swift file in the dataset, ensuring each file is uniquely identified by its ID?
# [Schema links]: ['GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES.id', 'GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES.repo_name', 'GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_FILES.path', 'GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS.copies', 'GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id', 'GITHUB_REPOS.SAMPLE_CONTENTS.binary']
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `SAMPLE_FILES` (id, repo_name, path) and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` (id, copies, binary).
2. Deduplicate files by grouping `SAMPLE_FILES` on id, repo_name, and path to ensure unique file identification.
3. Filter for non-binary files by joining with `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` where `binary = FALSE`.
4. Further filter for Swift files using `path LIKE '%.swift'`.
5. Select repo_name and copies from the joined and filtered results.
6. Sort the results by copies in descending order to find the highest value.
7. Return the top repo_name using `LIMIT 1`.
