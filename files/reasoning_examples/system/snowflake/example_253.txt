# [Question]: Could you please find the name of the repository that contains the most copied non-binary Swift file in the dataset, ensuring each file is uniquely identified by its ID?
# [Schema links]: ['SAMPLE_FILES.id', 'SAMPLE_FILES.repo_name', 'SAMPLE_FILES.path', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.binary', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.copies']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `SAMPLE_FILES` (containing file ID, repository name, and file path) and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` (containing file ID, binary flag, and copies count).
2. Since files might be duplicated in `SAMPLE_FILES`, create a CTE `selected_repos` to initially select the necessary columns: `id`, `repo_name`, and `path`.
3. Create another CTE `deduped_files` to ensure each file ID is unique by grouping by `id` and using `MIN` to select a single `repo_name` and `path` for each ID.
4. Join `deduped_files` with `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` on the `id` column to combine file metadata with content information.
5. Filter the results to include only non-binary files (`NOT c."binary"`) and Swift files (`f."path" LIKE '%.swift'`).
6. Order the results by the number of copies in descending order (`c."copies" DESC`) to find the file with the highest copies.
7. Limit the result to the top 1 row to get the repository name containing the most copied non-binary Swift file.
