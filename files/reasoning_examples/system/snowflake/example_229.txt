# [Question]: Calculate, for each histology type specified in the 'icd_o_3_histology' field (excluding those enclosed in square brackets), the average of the per-patient average log10(normalized_count + 1) expression levels of the IGF2 gene among LGG patients with valid IGF2 expression data. Match gene expression and clinical data using the ParticipantBarcode field.

# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to filter gene expression data for LGG patients and IGF2 gene from the EBPP_ADJUSTPANCAN_ILLUMINAHISEQ_RNASEQV2_GENEXP_FILTERED table.
2. Calculate the per-patient average log10(normalized_count + 1) for IGF2 expression, grouping by ParticipantBarcode and Symbol.
3. Identify the need to filter clinical data for LGG patients from CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED table using acronym = 'LGG'.
4. Filter out icd_o_3_histology values enclosed in square brackets using a regex pattern.
5. Extract relevant clinical data: icd_o_3_histology as data, bcr_patient_barcode as ParticipantBarcode, and create a constant symbol field.
6. Join the gene expression data (table1) and clinical data (table2) on ParticipantBarcode to match patients.
7. Calculate the average of the per-patient log expression values (data1) for each histology type (data2).
8. Group the final results by histology type to get the average expression for each histology.
