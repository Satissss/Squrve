# [Question]: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?
# [Schema links]: [cybersyn.stock_price_timeseries.ticker, cybersyn.stock_price_timeseries.date, cybersyn.stock_price_timeseries.value, cybersyn.stock_price_timeseries.variable_name]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `stock_price_timeseries` (ticker, date, value, variable_name).
2. Filter rows where `variable_name` is 'Post-Market Close', `date` is between 2024-01-01 and 2024-06-30, and `ticker` is one of the Magnificent 7 tech companies.
3. For each ticker, calculate the earliest date in the period using `MIN(date) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker)`.
4. For each ticker, capture the starting price as the first `value` on the earliest date using `FIRST_VALUE(value) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date ASC)`.
5. For each ticker, capture the latest date in the period using `MAX(date) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker)`.
6. For each ticker, capture the ending price as the last `value` on the latest date using `LAST_VALUE(value) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date ASC)`.
7. Create a CTE `ytd_performance` to store the ticker, start_of_year_price, latest_price, and associated dates.
8. Calculate the percentage change using the formula `((latest_price - start_of_year_price)/start_of_year_price)*100`.
9. Select `ticker` and the calculated `percentage_change_ytd` from the CTE.
10. Group results by `ticker` and all non-aggregated columns to avoid ambiguity.
11. Order the final results by `percentage_change_ytd` in descending order.
