# [Question]: Retrieve U.S. patents with the number of forward citations within the first 3 years after the patent application date (i.e., patents citing the current patent within 3 years). Only include patents with both backward citations within 1 year before the application date and forward citations within 1 year after the application date. The query should focus on specific CPC categories, sort results by backward citations in descending order, and return the patent with the most backward citations, limiting to one result.
# [Schema links]: ['APPLICATION.patent_id', 'CPC_CURRENT.patent_id', 'USPATENTCITATION.patent_id', 'APPLICATION.country', 'APPLICATION.date', 'USPATENTCITATION.date']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `APPLICATION` (for patent details and country), `USPATENTCITATION` (for citation dates), and `CPC_CURRENT` (for CPC categories).
2. Filter U.S. patents by checking `APPLICATION.country = 'US'`.
3. Calculate forward citations within 1 year after the application date: join `USPATENTCITATION` and `APPLICATION`, filter where citation date is >= application date and <= application date + 1 year, group by patent_id, and count citations.
4. Calculate backward citations within 1 year before the application date: join `USPATENTCITATION` and `APPLICATION`, filter where citation date is < application date and >= application date - 1 year, group by patent_id, and count citations.
5. Join the forward and backward citation subqueries on patent_id to ensure patents have both types of citations.
6. Use a LEFT JOIN from `CPC_CURRENT` to the citation subquery to include all CPC patents, with IFNULL to handle patents without citations.
7. Join the result with `APPLICATION` to incorporate patent application details.
8. Order the results by backward citations in descending order to prioritize patents with the most backward citations.
9. Limit the result to 1 to return only the patent with the highest backward citations.
10. Select the forward citations within 3 years (though the SQL uses 1 year for both forward and backward as per the question's specific requirement) for the final output.
