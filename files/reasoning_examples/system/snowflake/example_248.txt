# [Question]: Can you analyze the joined data from github repos files and github_repos contents, focusing only on files ending with '.py' or '.r', then extract Python modules from 'import' or 'from ... import' lines and R libraries from 'library(...)' lines, count their occurrences, and finally list the results sorted by language and by the number of occurrences in descending order?
# [Schema links]: ['SAMPLE_FILES.repo_name', 'SAMPLE_FILES.path', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS.content']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `SAMPLE_FILES` (repo_name, path, id) and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` (id, content).
2. Join `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` on the `id` column to combine file metadata with file content.
3. Filter the joined data to include only files ending with '.py' or '.r' using the `ENDSWITH` function on the `path` column.
4. Split the content of each file into individual lines using `SPLIT` and `REPLACE` to handle newlines.
5. Use `LATERAL FLATTEN` to transform each line into a separate row for processing.
6. Further filter lines: for Python files, keep lines starting with 'import' or 'from'; for R files, keep lines starting with 'library('.
7. Extract modules/libraries: for Python, use regex to capture module names from 'import' and 'from' lines; for R, use regex to capture library names from 'library(...)' lines.
8. Store extracted modules as arrays in a CTE named `extracted_modules`, including file metadata and language type.
9. Flatten the modules array using `LATERAL FLATTEN` to have each module in a separate row.
10. Count occurrences of each module per language using `COUNT` and group by `language` and `module` in a CTE named `module_counts`.
11. Separate the counts into two subsets: one for Python and one for R using CTEs `python` and `rlanguage`.
12. Combine the Python and R results using `UNION ALL`.
13. Sort the final output by language and then by occurrence count in descending order.
