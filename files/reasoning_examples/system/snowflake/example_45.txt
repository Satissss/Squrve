# [Question]: Identify the difference in the number of the oldest and youngest users registered between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, from our e-commerce platform data.
# [Schema links]: ["THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.gender", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.id", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.first_name", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.last_name", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.age", "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE.USERS.created_at"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant columns from the `USERS` table: `age`, `created_at`, and other user details for filtering and selection.
2. Filter users registered between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022 by converting `created_at` (stored as milliseconds) to a timestamp and applying the date range condition.
3. Determine the global minimum and maximum age values from the `USERS` table using subqueries.
4. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) `youngest` to select users with the minimum age who meet the registration date criteria.
5. Create another CTE `oldest` to select users with the maximum age who meet the registration date criteria.
6. Combine the `youngest` and `oldest` CTE results into a temporary table `TEMP_record`.
7. Calculate the difference by summing the count of oldest users (where age matches the global maximum) and subtracting the count of youngest users (where age matches the global minimum) from the combined records.
