# [Question]: Identify the top five patents filed in the same year as `US-9741766-B2` that are most similar to it based on technological similarities. Please provide the publication numbers.
# [Schema links]: ['PUBLICATIONS.publication_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.application_number', 'PUBLICATIONS.filing_date', 'ABS_AND_EMB.publication_number', 'ABS_AND_EMB.embedding_v1']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the target patent 'US-9741766-B2' and retrieve its basic information from the PUBLICATIONS table.
2. Extract the filing year of the target patent by converting the filing_date string and using EXTRACT(YEAR).
3. Find all patents that have the same filing year as the target patent, excluding the target patent itself.
4. Access the embedding vectors for both the target patent and the candidate patents from the ABS_AND_EMB table.
5. Flatten the embedding vectors for both the target patent and candidate patents to process individual vector elements.
6. Calculate cosine similarity by summing the products of corresponding vector elements (dot product) between the target and each candidate patent.
7. Group the results by candidate publication number and compute the similarity score for each.
8. Rank the candidate patents by similarity score in descending order for the target patent.
9. Select the top 5 patents with the highest similarity scores.
10. Return the publication numbers and their similarity scores for these top 5 patents.
