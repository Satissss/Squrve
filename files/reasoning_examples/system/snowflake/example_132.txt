# [Question]: Could you provide the details of the top 5 longest bike share trips that started between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, including the trip ID, duration in seconds, start date, start station name, route (derived from start station name to end station name), bike number, subscriber type, member's birth year, the member's current age (calculated using the current year), an age classification based on whether the member is younger than 40, between 40 and 60, or older than 60, the member's gender, and the name of the region of the start station? Please exclude any trips where the start station name, member's birth year, or member's gender is not specified.
# [Schema links]: ["BIKESHARE_TRIPS.trip_id", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.duration_sec", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.start_date", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.start_station_name", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.end_station_name", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.bike_number", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.subscriber_type", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.member_birth_year", "BIKESHARE_TRIPS.member_gender", "BIKESHARE_REGIONS.name", "BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO.name", "BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO.region_id", "BIKESHARE_REGIONS.region_id"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the required columns from BIKESHARE_TRIPS: trip_id, duration_sec, start_date, start_station_name, end_station_name, bike_number, subscriber_type, member_birth_year, member_gender.
2. Determine the need to join BIKESHARE_TRIPS with BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO using start_station_name = BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO.name to access region_id.
3. Join BIKESHARE_STATION_INFO with BIKESHARE_REGIONS on region_id to retrieve the region name.
4. Convert start_date from microseconds to a timestamp and then to a date for filtering and display.
5. Filter trips where start_date falls between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017.
6. Exclude rows where start_station_name, member_birth_year, or member_gender is NULL.
7. Calculate member's current age by subtracting member_birth_year from the current year.
8. Create age classification using CASE statement based on age ranges (<40, 40-60, >60).
9. Concatenate start_station_name and end_station_name to form the route.
10. Select the region name from BIKESHARE_REGIONS as region_name.
11. Order results by duration_sec in descending order and limit to top 5 records.
