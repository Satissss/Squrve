# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to filter for breast cancer (BRCA) patients and their histological types from the clinical table, ensuring histological_type is not null.
2. Extract the relevant BRCA patient barcodes and their histological types from CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED where acronym is 'BRCA'.
3. Identify the need to find patients with CDH1 gene mutations from the mutation table (MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE) for BRCA study, with FILTER='PASS'.
4. Extract the ParticipantBarcode for patients with CDH1 mutations in BRCA, grouping by ParticipantBarcode to avoid duplicates.
5. Perform a left join between the clinical data (table1) and mutation data (table2) on ParticipantBarcode to associate each patient with their mutation status (YES/NO for CDH1 mutation).
6. Group the joined data by histological_type and mutation status to count the number of patients (Nij) in each group.
7. For each histological_type, calculate the total number of patients and the count of patients with CDH1 mutations.
8. Compute the mutation percentage for each histological_type by dividing the mutation count by the total number of patients.
9. Order the histological types by mutation percentage in descending order to find the highest percentages.
10. Limit the result to the top five histological types to answer the question.
