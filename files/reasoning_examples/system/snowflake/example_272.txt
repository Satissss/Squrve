# [Question]: From the union of the specified MR series with SeriesInstanceUID 1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.3671.4754.105976129314091491952445656147 and all associated segmentation instances, which modality has the greatest number of SOP instances in total, and how many are there?
# [Schema links]: ['DICOM_ALL.SeriesInstanceUID', 'DICOM_ALL.SOPInstanceUID', 'SEGMENTATIONS.SOPInstanceUID', 'SEGMENTATIONS.SegmentedPropertyType', 'SEGMENTATIONS.SegmentedPropertyCategory', 'DICOM_ALL.Modality']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to combine the MR series with SeriesInstanceUID '1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.3671.4754.105976129314091491952445656147' and all associated segmentation instances.
2. Create a CTE named `union_mr_seg` to perform a UNION ALL between the MR series and segmentation instances.
3. For the MR series part: Select SOPInstanceUID from DICOM_ALL where SeriesInstanceUID matches the given UID, with empty strings for segmentation-related columns.
4. For the segmentation instances part: Join DICOM_ALL with SEGMENTATIONS on SOPInstanceUID to get segmentation instances, including their SegmentedPropertyType and SegmentedPropertyCategory CodeMeaning values.
5. After creating the union, join the result with the DICOM_ALL table again on SOPInstanceUID to get the Modality for each SOP instance.
6. Group the results by Modality and count the number of SOP instances in each group.
7. Order the results by the count in descending order and limit to 1 to find the modality with the greatest number of SOP instances.
