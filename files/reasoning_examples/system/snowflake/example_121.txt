# [Question]: Can you analyze the joined data from github repos files and github_repos contents, focusing only on files ending with '.py' or '.r', then extract Python modules from 'import' or 'from ... import' lines and R libraries from 'library(...)' lines, count their occurrences, and finally list the results sorted by language and by the number of occurrences in descending order?
# [Schema links]: ["SAMPLE_FILES.id", "SAMPLE_CONTENTS.id", "SAMPLE_FILES.repo_name", "SAMPLE_FILES.path", "SAMPLE_CONTENTS.content"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Join `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` on `id` to combine file metadata with content data.
2. Filter files to include only those with `.py` or `.r` extensions using `ENDSWITH` function.
3. Split each file's `content` into individual lines using `SPLIT` and `LATERAL FLATTEN`.
4. Classify each file's language as 'python' or 'r' based on file extension.
5. Extract modules using regex: 
   - For Python: Match `import` and `from` statements to capture module names.
   - For R: Match `library(...)` calls to capture library names.
6. Flatten extracted modules into individual rows using `LATERAL FLATTEN`.
7. Count occurrences of each module per language, filtering out empty values.
8. Split module counts into separate tables for Python and R.
9. Combine results from both languages with `UNION ALL`.
10. Sort final output by language and occurrence_count in descending order.
