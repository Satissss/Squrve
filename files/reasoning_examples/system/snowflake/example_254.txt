# [Question]: Among all multipolygons located within the same geographic area as the multipolygon associated with Wikidata item Q191, but lacking a 'wikidata' tag themselves, which two rank highest by the number of points that lie within their boundaries, and what are their names?
# [Schema links]: ['PLANET_FEATURES.all_tags', 'PLANET_FEATURES.feature_type', 'PLANET_FEATURES.geometry', 'PLANET_FEATURES.osm_id']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the multipolygon associated with Wikidata item Q191 to define the geographic area of interest.
2. Create a CTE `bounding_area` to retrieve the geometry of the multipolygon with the 'wikidata' tag value 'Q191'.
3. Create a CTE `bounding_area_features` to select all features (points, multipolygons, etc.) located within the bounding area using ST_DWITHIN with a 0.0 distance threshold.
4. Create a CTE `osm_id_with_wikidata` to identify all OSM IDs within the bounding area that have a 'wikidata' tag.
5. Create a CTE `polygons_wo_wikidata` to select multipolygons within the bounding area that lack a 'wikidata' tag, but have a 'name' tag, by left joining with `osm_id_with_wikidata` and filtering for NULL wikidata OSM IDs.
6. Count the number of points (from `bounding_area_features`) that lie within each multipolygon without a wikidata tag using ST_DWITHIN with a 0.0 distance threshold.
7. Join the point features (with wikidata tags) to the multipolygons without wikidata tags to establish spatial containment.
8. Group the results by the multipolygon name to aggregate the count of points within each multipolygon.
9. Order the results by the count of points in descending order to rank the multipolygons.
10. Limit the output to the top 2 multipolygons with the highest point counts.
11. Select the trimmed name of these multipolygons as the final output.
