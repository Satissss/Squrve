# [Question]: Can you provide a daily weather summary for July 2019 within a 5 km radius of latitude 26.75 and longitude 51.5? I need the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures; total precipitation; average cloud cover between 10 AM and 5 PM; total snowfall (when average temperature is below 32°F); and total rainfall (when average temperature is 32°F or above) for each forecast date. The data should correspond to forecasts created in July 2019 for the following day.
# [Schema links]: ["NOAA_GLOBAL_FORECAST_SYSTEM.NOAA_GFS0P25.creation_time", "NOAA_GLOBAL_FORECAST_SYSTEM.NOAA_GFS0P25.forecast", "NOAA_GLOBAL_FORECAST_SYSTEM.NOAA_GFS0P25.geography"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `NOAA_GLOBAL_FORECAST_SYSTEM.NOAA_GFS0P25` with `creation_time`, `forecast`, and `geography`.
2. Use `CROSS JOIN LATERAL FLATTEN` to process each forecast entry in the `forecast` array.
3. Filter forecasts created in July 2019 using `creation_time` converted to a timestamp between '2019-07-01' and '2019-07-31'.
4. Apply spatial filter `ST_DWITHIN` to include records within 5 km of latitude 26.75 and longitude 51.5.
5. Ensure forecasts are for the next day by comparing `forecast.time` to `creation_time` + 1 day.
6. Calculate `local_forecast_date` by converting `forecast.time` to a date with timezone adjustment.
7. Compute daily aggregates: `max_temp`, `min_temp`, `avg_temp` from `temperature_2m_above_ground`.
8. Sum `total_precipitation` from `total_precipitation_surface`.
9. Calculate `avg_cloud_cover` between 10 AM and 5 PM using time-based filtering.
10. Determine `total_snow` and `total_rain` based on average temperature thresholds (below/above 32°F).
11. Group results by `creation_time` and `local_forecast_date` to aggregate daily metrics.
12. Select required columns from the CTE and order by `creation_time` and `forecast_date`.
