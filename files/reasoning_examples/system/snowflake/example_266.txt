# [Question]: In the dicom_pivot table, how many unique StudyInstanceUID values exactly match the SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence of "15825003" (case-insensitive) and also have a collection_id of either "Community" or "nsclc_radiomics"?
# [Schema links]: ['DICOM_PIVOT.SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence', 'DICOM_PIVOT.collection_id', 'DICOM_PIVOT.StudyInstanceUID']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the need to count unique StudyInstanceUID values that meet two conditions: matching SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence and having a specific collection_id.
2. Since the SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence match should be case-insensitive, use LOWER() function to compare with the lowercase value '15825003'.
3. The collection_id must be either 'Community' or 'nsclc_radiomics', so use an IN clause for these values.
4. To find StudyInstanceUIDs that satisfy both conditions, use an intersection of two subqueries: one for SegmentedPropertyTypeCodeSequence and one for collection_id.
5. Group the results by StudyInstanceUID in each subquery to ensure uniqueness before the intersection.
6. Use the intersected StudyInstanceUIDs as a filter in the main query's WHERE clause with an IN subquery.
7. Finally, count the distinct StudyInstanceUIDs that pass this filter using COUNT(*).
