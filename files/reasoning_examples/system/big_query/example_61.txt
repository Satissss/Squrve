# [Question]: What is the highest number of answers received for a single Python 2 specific question on Stack Overflow, excluding any discussions that involve Python 3?
# [Schema links]: ["stackoverflow.posts_questions.id", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.title", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.body", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.tags", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.parent_id"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `posts_questions` (id, title, body, tags) and `posts_answers` (parent_id).
2. Filter `posts_questions` to include only questions tagged or mentioning Python 2 (e.g., 'python-2', 'python2') in title/body.
3. Exclude questions mentioning Python 3 (e.g., 'python3', 'python 3') in title/body using negation conditions.
4. Create a CTE `python2_questions` to store filtered Python 2-specific questions.
5. Join `python2_questions` with `posts_answers` on `question_id = parent_id` to associate answers with their questions.
6. Group the joined results by `question_id` to aggregate answers per question.
7. Count the number of answers for each question using `COUNT(*)`.
8. Sort the grouped results in descending order by the answer count.
9. Select the top result with `LIMIT 1` to retrieve the highest answer count.
