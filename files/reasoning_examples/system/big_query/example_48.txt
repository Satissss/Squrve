# [Question]: Which country has the highest percentage of population under the age of 25 in 2017?
# [Schema links]: ["census_bureau_international.midyear_population_agespecific.country_name", "census_bureau_international.midyear_population_agespecific.year", "census_bureau_international.midyear_population_agespecific.age", "census_bureau_international.midyear_population_agespecific.population"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `midyear_population_agespecific` (country_name, year, age, population).
2. Calculate total population per country for 2017 by summing all populations where `year=2017`, grouped by `country_name`.
3. Calculate population under 25 for each country in 2017 by summing populations where `year=2017` and `age < 25`, grouped by `country_name`.
4. Join the two calculations on `country_name` to combine under-25 population with total population.
5. Compute the percentage by dividing the under-25 population sum by the total population.
6. Sort countries by this percentage in descending order.
7. Select the top country with the highest percentage and return its name.
