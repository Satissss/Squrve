# [Question]: Retrieve details of accepted answers to Stack Overflow questions posted in January 2016 that have tags including "javascript" and at least one of "xss", "cross-site", "exploit", or "cybersecurity"; the answers themselves must also have been posted in January 2016. For each accepted answer, include the answer's ID, the answerer's reputation, score, and comment count, along with the associated question's tags, score, answer count, the asker's reputation, view count, and comment count.
# [Schema links]: ['posts_answers.id', 'users.reputation', 'posts_answers.score', 'posts_answers.comment_count', 'posts_questions.tags', 'posts_questions.score', 'posts_questions.answer_count', 'posts_questions.view_count', 'posts_questions.comment_count', 'posts_answers.parent_id', 'posts_questions.id', 'posts_questions.accepted_answer_id', 'posts_questions.creation_date', 'posts_answers.creation_date', 'posts_answers.owner_user_id', 'posts_questions.owner_user_id']
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `posts_answers`, `posts_questions`, and `users` for reputation data.
2. Join `posts_answers` with `posts_questions` on `answer.parent_id = questions.id` to link answers to their questions.
3. Filter for accepted answers by adding `answer.id = questions.accepted_answer_id` in the WHERE clause.
4. Apply date filters: `questions.creation_date` and `answer.creation_date` must be in January 2016 using `DATE(...) BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2016-01-31'`.
5. Check for required tags in `questions.tags`: include "javascript" and at least one of "xss", "cross-site", "exploit", or "cybersecurity" using `LIKE` conditions.
6. Select required answer fields: `answer.id`, `answer.score`, `answer.comment_count`, and answerer's reputation via a subquery on `users.id = answer.owner_user_id`.
7. Select required question fields: `questions.tags`, `questions.score`, `questions.answer_count`, `questions.view_count`, `questions.comment_count`, and asker's reputation via a subquery on `users.id = questions.owner_user_id`.
8. Combine all selected fields into the final SELECT statement with appropriate aliases.
