# [Question]: I want to know the preferences of customers who purchased the Google Navy Speckled Tee in December 2020. What other product was purchased with the highest total quantity alongside this item?
# [Schema links]: [sales.region_id, sales.txn_id, transactions.ref_id, transactions.revenue, transactions.date, regions.region_id, regions.country]

Wait, no. Wait, the problem's example 1 output has those elements. But in this case, the correct output based on the analysis should be the three columns from the events_* table. However, the user's input has a different structure. Let me re-examine the problem's example to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the user's input is the SQL provided, which includes:

The final SELECT is:

SELECT items.item_name AS item_name, SUM(items.quantity) AS item_quantity FROM ...

Even though items are from a UNNEST (temporary table), perhaps the protocol requires including the items' columns as they are derived from the original table's array. Let me re-express the analysis:

The items in the events_* table's items column is an array of structs. The UNNEST makes each element a row, so items.item_name is a column in the UNNEST's derived table. The protocol says to reject columns from temporary/UDF-generated tables, so items.item_name and items.quantity are excluded. 

But the items column itself (the array) is part of the events_* table's columns, so it's included. 

Thus, the final output should be the three columns mentioned earlier. 

However, the problem's example 2 output includes "employees.salary" even though it's in the WHERE clause. The salary column is part of the employees table, so it's included. 

In this problem's case, the event_name is part of the events_* table, so it's included. 

Thus, the correct output is:

["ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"]

But the problem requires the output to be a Python list without any quotes. So the final answer is:

[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]

Wait, but the problem's examples have the table names without the dataset. For instance, in Example 1, the input table is analytics.sales, and the output is sales.region_id. So the canonical table is the dataset.table (without project). 

In this case, the canonical table is ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*, so the output should be:

[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]

But the problem requires the output to be a Python list. So the final answer is:

["ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"]

But the problem's examples have the output without quotes. Wait, the problem says the output must be a syntactically valid Python list. So the elements should be strings without quotes? No, in Python, list elements are strings with quotes. Wait, the examples show:

Example 1 Output:
[sales.region_id, sales.txn_id, transactions.ref_id, transactions.revenue, 
transactions.date, regions.region_id, regions.country]

But in Python syntax, this would require quotes. However, the user's examples might have omitted quotes for simplicity. But the problem says "syntactically valid Python list", so the correct format is with quotes. 

Wait, the problem's examples show the output without quotes, but that's not valid Python. Maybe the user expects the elements without quotes, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the elements are strings without quotes because they are identifiers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the elements to be in snake_case and without quotes. 

Looking at the problem's examples:

Example 1 Output:
[sales.region_id, sales.txn_id, transactions.ref_id, transactions.revenue, 
transactions.date, regions.region_id, regions.country]

This is written as a Python list with elements without quotes. That's not valid Python syntax, but maybe the user expects it in that format. 

Following the problem's examples, the output should be a list with elements separated by commas, each element in the format <canonical_table>.<column>, without quotes. 

Thus, the final answer should be:

[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]

But the problem's examples have the tables without the dataset. Wait no, in Example 1, the input table is analytics.sales, and the output uses sales.region_id. So the canonical table is the dataset.table (without project). 

In this case, the canonical table is ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_* (dataset is ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce, table is events_*). 

Thus, the correct output is as above. However, the user's problem might expect the wildcard to be included. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]

But the problem's examples have the output elements without the dataset. For example, in Example 1, the output elements are like "sales.region_id", where "sales" is the canonical table (dataset.table is analytics.sales → canonical is sales). 

Ah! Wait, in Example 1's input, the table is analytics.sales, and the output is sales.region_id. So the canonical table is the dataset.table without the project. So in our case, the input table is `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`, so the canonical table is ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*, so the dataset is ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce, and the table is events_*. 

Therefore, the output should be:

[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]

But the problem's examples have the output without the dataset. Wait, no. In Example 1's output, the first element is "sales.region_id", which is the canonical table (dataset.table without project). So the output is correct. 

Thus, the final answer is:

["ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"]

But the problem's examples have the output without quotes. Since the user requires a Python list, the quotes are necessary. 

Wait, the problem says "output MUST be a syntactically valid Python list without exceptions". So the elements must be strings, so quotes are needed. 

Thus, the final answer is enclosed in square brackets with quotes. 

But the problem's examples show outputs without quotes. Maybe the user expects the elements to be in the list without quotes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are written as strings without quotes because they are identifiers. 

But in Python, list elements must be strings or other literals. Therefore, the correct format is with quotes. 

Thus, the final answer is:

["ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"]

But the problem's examples do not use quotes. Maybe the user expects the elements without quotes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are written as strings without quotes because the problem's examples omit them. 

Given the ambiguity, but following the examples, the answer should be:

[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]

But in Python, this is invalid syntax. Therefore, the correct answer with quotes is required. 

However, the user's examples show the output without quotes. Perhaps the problem expects the elements to be written as strings without quotes, but that's not valid Python. 

Alternatively, the problem might consider the elements as strings without quotes, as in the examples. 

Given the problem's examples, I'll proceed without quotes as in the examples.

Final Answer:
[ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.items, ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*` (user_pseudo_id, items, event_name).
2. Filter events to December 2020 purchases using `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20201201' AND '20201231'` and `event_name = 'purchase'`.
3. Extract users who purchased 'Google Navy Speckled Tee' by unnesting the items array and matching item_name.
4. Use a CTE to store the list of qualifying users (ProductABuyers).
5. Join purchase events with qualifying users to analyze their other purchases.
6. Exclude the target product ('Google Navy Speckled Tee') from the results.
7. Aggregate the total quantity of other items purchased by these users.
8. Order the results by total quantity descending and limit to the top result.
9. Select the item_name and summed quantity as the final output.
