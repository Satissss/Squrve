# [Question]: Could you provide the total number of page views for each day in November 2020 as well as the average number of page views per user on those days, restricted to users who made at least one purchase in November 2020?
# [Schema links]: ["ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_date", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.TABLE_SUFFIX"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `events_*` (user_pseudo_id, event_date, event_name, TABLE_SUFFIX).
2. Filter events to November 2020 using `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20201101' AND '20201130'`.
3. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) `UserInfo` to aggregate page_view and purchase counts per user per day.
4. In `UserInfo`, count page_view events as `page_view_count` and purchase events as `purchase_event_count` for each user and parsed `event_date`.
5. Filter in the main query to include only users with `purchase_event_count > 0` to restrict to purchasing users.
6. Calculate daily total page views by summing `page_view_count` across all qualifying users.
7. Compute the average page views per user by dividing total page views by the count of qualifying users (`COUNT(*)`).
8. Group results by `event_date` and order by `event_date` for chronological output.
