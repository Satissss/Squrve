# [Question]: How many distinct users viewed the most frequently visited page during January 2021?
# [Schema links]: ["ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_.event_params.key", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_.event_params.value.string_value", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_.user_pseudo_id", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_.event_timestamp", "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_.event_name"] 

Wait, there's a mistake here. The table name in the output above is written as "events_" instead of "events_*". Let me correct that:

The correct entries should have "events_*" as the table name. Also, the wildcard must be included as part of the table name. So the correct list is:

[
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_params.key",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_params.value.string_value",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_timestamp",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"
]

But in the problem's example outputs, the table names are like "sales" (without the dataset?), but according to the protocol, we need to include the dataset. So the format is correct. The final answer must be in a Python list format. However, when I check the problem's examples, the output lists do not include the dataset in the first example. Wait, looking back:

In Example 1's output:
[sales.region_id, sales.txn_id, transactions.ref_id, transactions.revenue, transactions.date, regions.region_id, regions.country]

The tables are "sales", "transactions", "regions". The dataset is "analytics.sales" in the input, so the output shows "sales.region_id" which is the table name without the dataset. Wait, this contradicts the protocol's §1.2 which says to capture `<dataset>.<table>`. But in the example, the output uses only the table name. 

Wait, let me recheck the protocol's §1.2:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table` Discard explicit aliases (AS clauses) and implicit aliases (subquery assignments)"

Ah, so the output should be in the format `<dataset>.<table>`, not including the project. But in the example given, the input has "analytics.sales" which becomes "sales" in the output. Wait, no, the example's output shows "sales.region_id", which implies that the dataset is "sales" but the actual dataset in the input is "analytics". This discrepancy suggests that maybe I misunderstood the protocol.

Wait the example input has:

WITH SalesData AS (
  SELECT 
    T1.region_id, 
    SUM(T2.revenue * exchange_rate) AS total
  FROM analytics.sales T1
  JOIN finance.transactions T2 
    ON T1.txn_id = T2.ref_id
  WHERE T2.date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND CURRENT_DATE()
)
SELECT 
  sd.region_id,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY r.country ORDER BY total DESC)
FROM SalesData sd
JOIN prod.regions r USING (region_id)

The output is:
[sales.region_id, sales.txn_id, transactions.ref_id, transactions.revenue, transactions.date, regions.region_id, regions.country]

Here, the tables in the input are "analytics.sales" (dataset is "analytics", table is "sales"), "finance.transactions", and "prod.regions". The output uses "sales", "transactions", and "regions" as the tables, which are the table names without the dataset. This contradicts the protocol's §1.2 which says to capture `<dataset>.<table>`.

Wait, this is a problem. The protocol says in §1.2 to capture the dataset and table, but the example output shows only the table names. This suggests that perhaps the protocol's instructions might have been misinterpreted. Let me re-read the protocol's §1.2:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table` Discard explicit aliases (AS clauses) and implicit aliases (subquery assignments)"

Ah, so the output should be in the format `<dataset>.<table>`, but in the example's output, the tables are listed as "sales", not "analytics.sales". This indicates that perhaps the dataset is not required in the final output's table names. 

Wait, the example's output shows "sales.region_id", which implies that the table is "sales" (without the dataset). But according to the protocol's §1.2, the table should be captured as `<dataset>.<table>`. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

Looking back at the example's input:

The FROM clause in the first CTE is "analytics.sales T1". According to the protocol, the table should be normalized to "analytics.sales". However, the example's output lists "sales.region_id", implying that the dataset is omitted. This suggests that the protocol's instructions might have a mistake, or perhaps I misunderstood.

Wait, maybe the protocol's §3.1c says to format as `<canonical_table>.<raw_column>`, where the canonical table is the normalized table from §1.2. So in the example's case, the canonical table for "analytics.sales" is "analytics.sales", so the column should be "analytics.sales.region_id". But the example's output shows "sales.region_id". This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the protocol's instructions in the example are using the table name without the dataset, which contradicts the protocol's own instructions.

This is confusing. Let me re-examine the protocol's §1.2:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table`"

So the canonical table is `<dataset>.<table>`, which for "project.dataset.table" becomes "dataset.table". So in the example's input, "analytics.sales" is already in the correct format (no project), so it remains "analytics.sales". But the example's output shows "sales" as the table, which is just the table name. This suggests that maybe the protocol's examples are incorrect, or perhaps the instructions have an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the protocol's §3.1c says to format as `<canonical_table>.<raw_column>`, where the canonical table is the normalized table from §1.2 (dataset.table). Therefore, the example's output should have "analytics.sales.region_id", but the given example shows "sales.region_id". This inconsistency means I must follow the protocol's instructions strictly, even if the example seems to contradict it.

Therefore, in the current problem, the base table is `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`, so the canonical table is `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`. Therefore, the columns should be prefixed with that.

But in the example's output, the tables are listed without the dataset. This is conflicting. Perhaps the protocol's examples are using a different interpretation where the dataset is omitted? Or maybe the protocol's §1.2 requires the dataset and table to be captured, but the example's output is wrong?

Alternatively, maybe the dataset is part of the table's name. For example, in the example, "analytics.sales" is the full table name, so the dataset is "analytics", and the table is "sales", so the canonical table is "analytics.sales", which matches the protocol's requirement. The example's output shows "sales.region_id", which would be incorrect according to the protocol. 

This inconsistency is problematic. To resolve this, perhaps the protocol's examples are using a simplified format where the dataset is omitted, but according to the protocol's instructions, the dataset must be included. Therefore, I must adhere to the protocol's instructions even if the examples seem to contradict it.

Thus, the correct output for the current problem should include the dataset in the table name. Hence, the final list is as I initially thought:

[
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_params.key",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_params.value.string_value",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_timestamp",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"
]

But in the problem's examples, the outputs do not include the dataset, so perhaps I misunderstood the protocol. Let me re-examine the protocol's §3.1c:

"Format as <canonical_table>.<raw_column> (canonical_table from §1.2 normalization)"

§1.2 says to convert to `<dataset>.<table>`, so the canonical table includes the dataset. Therefore, the example's output must have "analytics.sales.region_id", but the example shows "sales.region_id". Therefore, there's a mistake in the example, but I must follow the protocol's instructions.

Alternatively, maybe the protocol's examples are using the table's name without the dataset because the dataset is part of the table's name. For instance, in the example's input, "analytics.sales" is the table's fully qualified name, so the canonical table is "analytics.sales". Therefore, the example's output should show "analytics.sales.region_id", but it shows "sales.region_id". This suggests that perhaps the protocol's §1.2 requires the table name only, discarding the dataset.

This is very confusing. Let me re-read the protocol's §1.2 again:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table` Discard explicit aliases (AS clauses) and implicit aliases (subquery assignments)"

Ah, so the canonical table is `<dataset>.<table>`. Therefore, even if the input is "analytics.sales", it remains "analytics.sales" as the canonical table. Hence, the example's output is incorrect, but I must follow the protocol's instructions.

Therefore, the correct output for the current problem is the list I derived earlier, with the dataset included. However, the user's examples do not include the dataset, which might mean that the protocol's instructions are to omit the dataset. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the protocol's §1.2 requires that the dataset is omitted, and only the table name is kept. Let me re-examine the wording:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table`"

Wait, the conversion is from project.dataset.table → dataset.table. So the canonical table is dataset.table. So the example's "analytics.sales" is already in that format (no project), so it remains. Therefore, the example's output should have "analytics.sales.region_id". But the example shows "sales.region_id", so there's a discrepancy.

This suggests that perhaps the protocol's examples are incorrect, or there's a misinterpretation. To resolve this, perhaps the protocol's §1.2 requires that the canonical table is the table name without the dataset, but that contradicts the instructions. Alternatively, maybe the dataset is part of the table's name, so "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce" is the dataset, and "events_*" is the table. Therefore, the canonical table is "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*".

Hence, the correct output must include the dataset in the table name. Therefore, the final answer is as I had before, but in the required Python list format.

Wait, but the user's examples show that in Example 2, the output is [employees.dept_id, employees.salary, employees.start_date], where the table is "hr_data.employees". According to the protocol's instructions, the canonical table should be "hr_data.employees", so the output should be "hr_data.employees.dept_id", etc. But the example shows "employees.dept_id". This indicates that the protocol's instructions might have been misinterpreted, and the dataset is being omitted.

This is a critical point. Perhaps the protocol's §1.2 says to capture the dataset and table, but the example's output is wrong, or the protocol's instructions are to extract only the table name without the dataset. Let me re-examine the protocol's §1.2:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table`"

Ah! The phrase "Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments" suggests that the output should be in the format dataset.table, but the example's output shows only the table name. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the protocol's §3.1c says to format as `<canonical_table>.<raw_column>`, where the canonical_table is the normalized table from §1.2 (which includes the dataset). Therefore, the example's output is incorrect, but I must follow the protocol's instructions.

Therefore, proceeding with the correct format according to the protocol's instructions, the final answer is:

[
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_params.key",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_params.value.string_value",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.user_pseudo_id",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_timestamp",
    "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*.event_name"
]

But the user's examples do not include the dataset, so perhaps the protocol's instructions have a mistake and the dataset should be omitted. If I follow the examples, then the dataset is omitted, and the table name is used. Let's see:

In Example 1, the input has "analytics.sales" as the table, and the output lists "sales.region_id", so the canonical table is just the table name. Therefore, the protocol's §1.2 must have been misinterpreted. Perhaps the dataset is not required, and only the table name is kept. 

Looking back at the protocol's §1.2:

"Capture ONLY `<dataset>.<table>` segments (ignore project/database prefixes) Convert `project.dataset.table` → `dataset.table`"

Wait, the "Capture ONLY" part refers to the segments, so the full table name is `<dataset>.<table>`, but when converted from a project, it becomes `<dataset>.<table>`. Therefore, the canonical table is `<dataset>.<table>`. But the example's output shows only the table name. This suggests that perhaps the protocol's examples are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the protocol's §1.2 requires that the canonical table is the table's name without the dataset. For instance, if the input is "analytics.sales", the canonical table is "sales". That would align with the examples. But according to the protocol's instructions, that's not what it says.

This is a critical point. To resolve this, perhaps I should follow the example's format, even if it contradicts the protocol's wording. The examples show that the output uses the table name without the dataset. Therefore, the canonical table is just the table name. Hence, the dataset is omitted.

In that case, the base table in the current problem is `events_*`, and the canonical table is just `events_*`. Therefore, the columns are:

- events_*.event_params.key
- events_*.event_params.value.string_value
- events_*.user_pseudo_id
- events_*.event_timestamp
- events_*.event_name

Thus, the final output list would be:

[
    "events_.event_params.key",
    "events_.event_params.value.string_value",
    "events_.user_pseudo_id",
    "events_.event_timestamp",
    "events_.event_name"
]

Wait, but the wildcard is part of the table name. So it should be "events_*".

Therefore:

[
    "events_*.event_params.key",
    "events_*.event_params.value.string_value",
    "events_*.user_pseudo_id",
    "events_*.event_timestamp",
    "events_*.event_name"
]

But in the example's first input, the table is "analytics.sales", and the output shows "sales.region_id", which aligns with this approach. Therefore, this must be the correct interpretation.

Thus, the final answer is:

["events_.event_params.key", "events_.event_params.value.string_value", "events_.user_pseudo_id", "events_.event_timestamp", "events_.event_name"]

Wait, but the wildcard is part of the table name. So it should be "events_*".

Therefore, the correct list is:

[
    "events_*.event_params.key",
    "events_*.event_params.value.string_value",
    "events_*.user_pseudo_id",
    "events_*.event_timestamp",
    "events_*.event_name"
]

This matches the example's format where the table name is used without the dataset. Therefore, this must be the correct approach.

Therefore, the final answer is:

["events_.event_params.key", "events_.event_params.value.string_value", "events_.user_pseudo_id", "events_.event_timestamp", "events_.event_name"] → but with the wildcard:

Wait, the table is `events_*`, so it should be "events_*.event_params.key", etc.

So the correct Python list is:

[
    "events_*.event_params.key",
    "events_*.event_params.value.string_value",
    "events_*.user_pseudo_id",
    "events_*.event_timestamp",
    "events_*.event_name"
]

But let's check the example's first input again. The input has "analytics.sales" and the output uses "sales". So the canonical table is just the table name. Therefore, the current problem's canonical table is "events_*", so the columns are prefixed with that.

Therefore, the final answer is the list above.

# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `events_*` (event_params.key, event_params.value.string_value, user_pseudo_id, event_timestamp, event_name).
2. Unnest the `event_params` array to access individual key-value pairs and extract the `page_location` value where key='page_location'.
3. Filter events to January 2021 using `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20210101' AND '20210131'` and event_name='page_view'.
4. Group by `page_location` to count total events per page and distinct users per page.
5. Determine the page with the highest event count by ordering results in descending order and selecting the top row.
6. Select the `users` count from the top result to get the number of distinct users for the most visited page.
