# [Question]: Calculate the net difference between the number of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) patients in TCGA's dataset who are confirmed to have mutations in both KRAS and TP53 genes, and those without mutations in either gene. Utilize patient clinical and follow-up data alongside genomic mutation details from TCGA’s cancer genomics database, focusing specifically on PAAD studies where the mutations have passed quality filters.
# [Schema links]: ["pancancer_atlas.Filtered_clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup.bcr_patient_barcode", "pancancer_atlas.Filtered_clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup.acronym", "pancancer_atlas.Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample.ParticipantBarcode", "pancancer_atlas.Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample.Study", "pancancer_atlas.Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample.Hugo_Symbol", "pancancer_atlas.Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample.FILTER"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `Filtered_clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup` (for PAAD patient barcodes) and `Filtered_MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample` (for mutation data with quality filters).
2. Extract PAAD patient barcodes from clinical data where `acronym = 'PAAD'` into a CTE named `barcodes`.
3. Create `table1` to flag KRAS mutation status by left joining `barcodes` with filtered MAF data for `KRAS` mutations in PAAD studies passing `FILTER = 'PASS'`.
4. Create `table2` similarly for TP53 mutation status using the same method as `table1` but with `Hugo_Symbol = 'TP53'`.
5. Join `table1` and `table2` on `ParticipantBarcode` to cross-reference mutation statuses for both genes, grouping by their `data1` (KRAS) and `data2` (TP53) flags.
6. Count occurrences (`Nij`) for each combination of mutation statuses (both YES/NO pairs) in the `INFO` CTE.
7. Calculate the net difference by subtracting the count of patients without either mutation (`NO`/`NO`) from those with both mutations (`YES`/`YES`).
