# [Question]: Which top 3 countries had the highest net migration in 2017 among those with an area greater than 500 square kilometers? And what are their migration rates?
# [Schema links]: ["birth_death_growth_rates.country_name", "birth_death_growth_rates.net_migration", "birth_death_growth_rates.country_code", "country_names_area.country_code", "country_names_area.country_area", "birth_death_growth_rates.year"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required tables: `birth_death_growth_rates` (for net_migration and year) and `country_names_area` (for country_area).
2. Join the tables on `country_code` to link migration data with country area information.
3. Filter records where `year` is 2017 and `country_area` exceeds 500 square kilometers.
4. Select `country_name` and `net_migration` columns from the joined tables.
5. Sort the filtered results in descending order by `net_migration` to get the highest values first.
6. Limit the output to the top 3 records to identify the countries with the highest net migration.
