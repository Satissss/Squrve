# [Question]: Calculate the total number of trips and average fare (formatted to two decimal places) for ten equal quantile groups of taxi trips based on rounded minute durations between 1-50 minutes, displaying each group's formatted time range (XXm to XXm) sorted chronologically, where quantile groups are created from ordered trip durations and time ranges represent the minimum/maximum values within each quantile partition
# [Schema links]: ["chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips.trip_seconds", "chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips.fare"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required columns: `trip_seconds` (to calculate duration) and `fare` from the `chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` table.
2. Convert `trip_seconds` to duration_in_minutes by rounding `trip_seconds / 60`.
3. Filter trips where duration_in_minutes is between 1 and 50 minutes using `WHERE ROUND(trip_seconds / 60) BETWEEN 1 AND 50`.
4. Partition trips into 10 equal quantile groups using `NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY trip_seconds / 60)` to create the `quantile` column.
5. Calculate the minimum and maximum duration_in_minutes for each quantile using window functions `MIN() OVER (PARTITION BY quantile)` and `MAX() OVER (PARTITION BY quantile)`.
6. Aggregate total trips and total fare for each quantile group by grouping on `quantile` and `duration_in_minutes`.
7. Format the time range as 'XXm to XXm' using `FORMAT('%02.0fm to %02.0fm', min_minutes, max_minutes)`.
8. Compute total_trips and average_fare (total_fare / total_trips) for each formatted time range.
9. Group results by the formatted minutes_range to ensure proper aggregation.
10. Sort the final output chronologically by the minutes_range.
