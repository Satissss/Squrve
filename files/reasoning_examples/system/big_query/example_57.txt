# [Question]: Retrieve the approved symbol of target genes with the highest overall score that are associated with the disease 'EFO_0000676' from the data source 'IMPC'.
# [Schema links]: ["open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect.targetId", "open_targets_platform.associationByDatasourceDirect.datasourceId", "open_targets_platform.targets.approvedSymbol", "open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect.score", "open_targets_platform.targets.id", "open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect.targetId", "open_targets_platform.associationByOverallDirect.diseaseId"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required columns: `approvedSymbol` from `targets`, `score` from `associationByOverallDirect`, and filter by `diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'` and `datasourceId = 'impc'`.
2. Join `associationByDatasourceDirect` (T1) with `targets` on `targetId = targets.id` to access gene symbols.
3. Join T1 with `associationByOverallDirect` on `T1.targetId = overall_associations.targetId` to link scores and disease associations.
4. Apply filters in the WHERE clause: `overall_associations.diseaseId = 'EFO_0000676'` and `T1.datasourceId = 'impc'`.
5. Sort the results by `overall_associations.score` in descending order to prioritize the highest score.
6. Select the top record using LIMIT 1 to retrieve the gene with the highest score meeting the criteria.
