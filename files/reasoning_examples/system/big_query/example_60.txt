# [Question]: Please provide the display name of the user who has answered the most questions on Stack Overflow, considering only users with a reputation greater than 10.
# [Schema links]: ["stackoverflow.users.display_name", "stackoverflow.users.id", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.owner_user_id", "stackoverflow.users.reputation"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `users` (display_name, id, reputation) and `posts_answers` (owner_user_id).
2. Count the number of answers per user by grouping `posts_answers` by `owner_user_id`.
3. Create a subquery to calculate `answer_count` for each `owner_user_id`.
4. Join the `users` table with the subquery on `users.id = posts_answers.owner_user_id`.
5. Filter users with `reputation > 10` using a WHERE clause.
6. Sort the joined results in descending order by `answer_count`.
7. Select the top result using `LIMIT 1` to get the user with the highest answer count.
8. Return the `display_name` of the selected user.
# [Sql]: SELECT    T1.display_name FROM    bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users AS T1 JOIN (   SELECT      owner_user_id,      COUNT(*) AS answer_count   FROM      bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers   GROUP BY      owner_user_id ) AS T2 ON    T1.id = T2.owner_user_id WHERE    T1.reputation > 10 ORDER BY    T2.answer_count DESC LIMIT 1;    ### Explanation of Fixes: 1. **Error Analysis**: The error message indicated that the column user_id was not found in table T1. Upon reviewing the schema, the correct column name for user identification in the USERS table is id, not user_id.     2. **Schema Compliance**: The USERS table contains a column named id (not user_id) and display_name. The POSTS_ANSWERS table contains owner_user_id, which corresponds to the id column in the USERS table.  3. **DBMS Compatibility**: BigQuery uses backticks () for table and column names when referencing fully qualified paths like bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users.  4. **Error-Free Guarantee**: The corrected query ensures proper column references and adheres to BigQuery's SQL syntax standards. It joins the USERS table with an aggregated subquery from POSTS_ANSWERS using the correct column names and filters users with a reputation greater than 10. The result is ordered by the count of answers in descending order, and the top result is returned using LIMIT 1.
