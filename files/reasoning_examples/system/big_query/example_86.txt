# [Question]: Can you figure out the average difference in pageviews between users who bought something and those who didn’t in December 2020? Just label anyone who was involved in purchase events as a purchaser.
# [Schema links]: ["events.user_pseudo_id", "events.event_name"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant columns: `user_pseudo_id`, `event_name` from the `events_*` table.
2. Filter events for December 2020 using `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20201201' AND '20201231'`.
3. Create a CTE `UserInfo` to calculate per-user metrics: `page_view_count` (COUNTIF event_name='page_view'), and `purchase_event_count` (COUNTIF event_name in ('in_app_purchase', 'purchase')).
4. Group `UserInfo` by `user_pseudo_id` to aggregate individual user statistics.
5. Create a CTE `Averages` to categorize users into purchasers (purchase_event_count > 0) and non-purchasers.
6. Calculate average page views for each group by dividing total page views by user count within each category.
7. Compute the difference between the two averages using conditional aggregation with CASE statements in the final SELECT.
