# [Question]: Which target approved symbol has the overall association score closest to the mean score for psoriasis?
# [Schema links]: [platform.associationByOverallDirect.score, platform.targets.approvedSymbol, platform.associationByOverallDirect.diseaseId, platform.diseases.id, platform.associationByOverallDirect.targetId, platform.targets.id, platform.diseases.name]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `associationByOverallDirect` (score, diseaseId, targetId), `diseases` (id, name), and `targets` (approvedSymbol, id).
2. Calculate the average association score for psoriasis by joining `associationByOverallDirect` with `diseases` on `diseaseId = id` where `diseases.name = 'psoriasis'`.
3. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `AvgScore` to store the calculated average score.
4. Join `associationByOverallDirect` with `diseases` and `targets` tables to link scores with their corresponding target approved symbols and disease name.
5. Cross join the main query with the `AvgScore` CTE to access the average score in calculations.
6. Filter records where `diseases.name = 'psoriasis'` to ensure relevance to the disease.
7. Compute the absolute difference between each association score and the average score using `ABS(associations.score - AvgScore.avg_score)`.
8. Order the results by the computed absolute difference in ascending order to find the closest match.
9. Limit the result to the top record to get the target with the closest score to the mean.
