# [Question]: From July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, for all users with IDs between 16712208 and 18712208 on Stack Overflow, retrieve the user ID and the tags of the relevant question for each of their contributions, including comments on both questions and answers, any answers they posted, and any questions they authored, making sure to correctly associate the comment or answer with its parent question’s tags.
# [Schema links]: ["stackoverflow.comments.user_id", "stackoverflow.comments.creation_date", "stackoverflow.comments.text", "stackoverflow.comments.post_id", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.id", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.parent_id", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.owner_user_id", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.creation_date", "stackoverflow.posts_answers.body", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.id", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.tags", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.owner_user_id", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.creation_date", "stackoverflow.posts_questions.body"]
# [Analysis]: Let’s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `comments` (user_id, post_id, creation_date, text), `posts_answers` (id, parent_id, owner_user_id, creation_date, body), `posts_questions` (id, tags, owner_user_id, creation_date, body).
2. Split comments into two groups: those on answers (via `posts_answers.parent_id` to link to questions) and those on questions (directly via `comments.post_id`).
3. For comments on answers, join `comments` with `posts_answers` on `post_id = id` to get the parent question ID (`parent_id`), then join with `posts_questions` to retrieve tags.
4. For comments on questions, directly join `comments` with `posts_questions` on `post_id = id` to get tags.
5. Combine both comment groups using `UNION ALL` into a subquery to handle all comments with their associated question IDs.
6. For answers, join `posts_answers` with `posts_questions` on `parent_id = id` to retrieve question tags, filtering by user and date.
7. For questions authored, directly select from `posts_questions` to get tags and user details, filtering by user and date.
8. Combine all three contributions (comments, answers, questions) using `UNION ALL`, ensuring each includes `u_id`, `tags`, and other required columns for union compatibility.
9. Select only `u_id` and `tags` from the combined result and order by `u_id` and `creation_date`.
