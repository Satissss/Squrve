# [Question]: What is the total distance traveled by each bike in the San Francisco Bikeshare program? Use data from bikeshare trips and stations to calculate this.
# [Schema links]: [san_francisco.bikeshare_trips.bike_number, san_francisco.bikeshare_stations.longitude, san_francisco.bikeshare_stations.latitude, san_francisco.bikeshare_trips.start_station_id, san_francisco.bikeshare_stations.station_id, san_francisco.bikeshare_trips.end_station_id]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the required tables: `bikeshare_trips` (bike_number, start_station_id, end_station_id) and `bikeshare_stations` (station_id, longitude, latitude).
2. Join `bikeshare_trips` with `bikeshare_stations` twice: once for start stations (bs1) using `start_station_id`, and once for end stations (bs2) using `end_station_id`.
3. Calculate the distance for each trip using `ST_DISTANCE` between the start and end station coordinates converted with `ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude)`.
4. Sum the calculated distances for each `bike_number` to get the total distance traveled.
5. Group the results by `bike_number` to aggregate the total distance per bike.
