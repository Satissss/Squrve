# [Question]: What is the average trip duration in minutes for all valid Yellow taxi trips that took place between February 1, 2016, and February 7, 2016 (inclusive), with a positive trip duration, more than three passengers, and a trip distance of at least ten miles, where both the pickup and dropoff locations are in Brooklyn?
# [Schema links]: ["tlc_yellow_trips_2016.dropoff_datetime", "tlc_yellow_trips_2016.pickup_datetime", "tlc_yellow_trips_2016.pickup_location_id", "taxi_zone_geom.zone_id", "tlc_yellow_trips_2016.dropoff_location_id", "tlc_yellow_trips_2016.passenger_count", "tlc_yellow_trips_2016.trip_distance", "taxi_zone_geom.borough"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the tables and columns: `tlc_yellow_trips_2016` (pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, pickup_location_id, dropoff_location_id, passenger_count, trip_distance) and `taxi_zone_geom` (zone_id, borough).
2. Join `tlc_yellow_trips_2016` with `taxi_zone_geom` twice: once for pickup locations (alias `tz_pickup`) using `pickup_location_id = zone_id`, and once for dropoff locations (alias `tz_dropoff`) using `dropoff_location_id = zone_id`.
3. Calculate trip duration in minutes using `TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, SECOND) / 60.0`.
4. Filter trips where `pickup_datetime` and `dropoff_datetime` are between '2016-02-01' and '2016-02-07'.
5. Apply conditions: `trip duration > 0`, `passenger_count > 3`, `trip_distance >= 10`, and both `tz_pickup.borough` and `tz_dropoff.borough` equal 'Brooklyn'.
6. Compute the average of the calculated trip duration using `AVG()`.
# [Sql]: SELECT     AVG(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, SECOND) / 60.0) AS average_trip_duration_in_minutes FROM     `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2016` t INNER JOIN     `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom` tz_pickup     ON t.pickup_location_id = tz_pickup.zone_id INNER JOIN     `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.taxi_zone_geom` tz_dropoff     ON t.dropoff_location_id = tz_dropoff.zone_id WHERE     t.pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2016-02-01' AND '2016-02-07'     AND t.dropoff_datetime BETWEEN '2016-02-01' AND '2016-02-07'     AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(t.dropoff_datetime, t.pickup_datetime, SECOND) > 0     AND t.passenger_count > 3     AND t.trip_distance >= 10     AND tz_pickup.borough = 'Brooklyn'     AND tz_dropoff.borough = 'Brooklyn';
