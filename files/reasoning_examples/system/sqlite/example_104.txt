# [Question]: Could you list each musical style with the number of times it appears as a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference in a single row per style?
# [Schema links]: ['Musical_Styles.StyleName', 'Musical_Preferences.PreferenceSeq', 'Musical_Styles.StyleID', 'Musical_Preferences.StyleID']
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `Musical_Styles` (StyleName, StyleID) and `Musical_Preferences` (StyleID, PreferenceSeq).
2. Join `Musical_Styles` and `Musical_Preferences` on `StyleID` to associate style names with their preference sequences.
3. Use `CASE` expressions to count occurrences where `PreferenceSeq` is 1, 2, or 3 for each style.
4. Aggregate counts using `SUM` for each preference sequence category (First, Second, Third).
5. Group results by `StyleName` to ensure one row per musical style.
6. Select `StyleName` and the aggregated counts as columns in the final output.
