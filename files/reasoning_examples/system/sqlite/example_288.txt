# [Question]: Distribute all the unique city pairs into the distance ranges 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000+, based on their average distance of all routes between them. Then how many pairs are there in the distance range with the fewest unique city paires?
# [Schema links]: ['FLIGHTS.flight_id', 'FLIGHTS.departure_airport', 'FLIGHTS.arrival_airport', 'AIRPORTS_DATA.airport_code', 'AIRPORTS_DATA.city', 'AIRPORTS_DATA.coordinates']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables: `FLIGHTS` (flight_id, departure_airport, arrival_airport) and `AIRPORTS_DATA` (airport_code, city, coordinates).
2. Join `FLIGHTS` with `AIRPORTS_DATA` twice (as DEPARTURE and ARRIVAL) to get city names and coordinates for both departure and arrival airports.
3. Extract city names from JSON field using `PARSE_JSON(city):"en"` for both departure and arrival.
4. Parse coordinates by splitting on comma and converting to numeric values for longitude and latitude for both departure and arrival.
5. Calculate the distance between cities using the Haversine formula with the extracted coordinates.
6. Group by unique city pairs (`from_city`, `to_city`) and compute the average distance for each pair.
7. Bin the average distances into 1000 km ranges using `FLOOR(average_distance_km / 1000) * 1000`.
8. Count the number of unique city pairs in each distance range.
9. Order the counts in ascending order and select the smallest count using `LIMIT 1`.
10. Return the count of pairs in the range with the fewest unique city pairs.
