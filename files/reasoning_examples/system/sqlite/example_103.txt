# [Question]: I need you to look into the actor collaborations and tell me how many actors have made more films with Yash Chopra than with any other director. This will help us understand his influence on the industry better.
# [Schema links]: ["Person.PID", "M_Cast.PID", "M_Cast.MID", "M_Director.PID", "M_Director.MID"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify Yash Chopra's PID from the Person table where Name = 'Yash Chopra' using a CTE.
2. Create CTE ActorMoviesWithYash to count movies each actor (M_Cast.PID) worked with Yash Chopra by joining M_Cast and M_Director where director is Yash Chopra.
3. Create CTE ActorMoviesWithOthers to count movies each actor worked with other directors by excluding Yash Chopra and grouping by actor and director.
4. Derive ActorMaxMoviesWithOthers CTE to find the maximum movie count any non-Yash director has with each actor.
5. Join ActorMoviesWithYash with ActorMaxMoviesWithOthers to compare Yash's count against the max non-Yash count for each actor.
6. Count distinct actors where Yash's movie count exceeds the maximum count from any other director, using IFNULL to handle NULL values.
