# [Question]: Could you generate a report that shows the number of delivered orders for each month in the years 2016, 2017, and 2018? Each column represents a year, and each row represents a month
# [Schema links]: ['OLIST_ORDERS.order_delivered_customer_date', 'OLIST_ORDERS.order_status', 'OLIST_ORDERS.customer_id', 'OLIST_ORDERS.order_id']
# [Analysis]: # Output: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant table and columns: `OLIST_ORDERS` with columns `order_delivered_customer_date`, `order_status`, `customer_id`, and `order_id`.
2. Filter the data to include only delivered orders where `order_status` = 'delivered' and ensure `order_delivered_customer_date` is not null and not empty.
3. Extract the year and month from `order_delivered_customer_date` using `TO_VARCHAR(TO_DATE(...))` to get 'YYYY' for year and 'MM' for month.
4. Group the data by `customer_id`, `order_id`, `order_delivered_customer_date`, and `order_status` to ensure each order is counted once.
5. Create a subquery (aliased as A) to produce this filtered and transformed dataset.
6. In the outer query, group the results by the extracted month ("Month").
7. Use conditional aggregation with `SUM(CASE ... END)` to count orders for each year (2016, 2017, 2018) within each month group.
8. Alias the conditional sums as "Year2016", "Year2017", and "Year2018" respectively.
9. Order the final result by the month number ("month_no") in ascending order.
