# [Question]: Can you identify the year and month with the highest rental orders created by the store's staff for each store? Please list the store ID, the year, the month, and the total rentals for those dates.
# [Schema links]: ["rental.staff_id", "rental.rental_date", "rental.rental_id", "staff.staff_id", "staff.store_id"]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant tables and columns: `rental` (staff_id, rental_date, rental_id) and `staff` (staff_id, store_id).
2. Join the `rental` and `staff` tables on `staff_id` to associate rentals with their corresponding store.
3. Extract the year and month from `rental_date` using `strftime` and group rental counts by store_id, year, and month.
4. Create a CTE `rental_counts` to store aggregated results of total rentals per store per month.
5. Create another CTE `max_rentals` to determine the maximum total_rentals for each store from `rental_counts`.
6. Join `rental_counts` with `max_rentals` on store_id and matching total_rentals to filter rows with maximum rentals.
7. Select the required columns (store_id, year, month, total_rentals) from the joined result and order by store_id and date.
