# [Question]: Which university faculty members' salaries are closest to the average salary for their respective ranks? Please provide the ranks, first names, last names, and salaries.university
# [Schema links]: [university_faculty.FacRank, university_faculty.FacFirstName, university_faculty.FacLastName, university_faculty.FacSalary]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Identify the relevant columns: `FacRank`, `FacFirstName`, `FacLastName`, `FacSalary` from the `university_faculty` table.
2. Calculate the average salary for each faculty rank using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `AvgSalaries`.
3. Join the `university_faculty` table with `AvgSalaries` on `FacRank` to align each faculty member's salary with their rank's average.
4. Compute the absolute difference between each faculty member's salary and their rank's average salary.
5. For each rank, determine the minimum absolute difference between any faculty member's salary and the rank's average salary.
6. Select faculty members where their absolute salary difference matches the minimum difference for their respective rank.
7. Structure the final query to return the required columns: rank, first name, last name, and salary.
