# [Question]: In which year were the two most common causes of traffic accidents different from those in other years?
# [Schema links]: [collisions.collision_date, collisions.case_id, collisions.pcf_violation_category]
# [Analysis]: Letâ€™s think step by step.
1. Extract the year from `collision_date` to group collisions by year.
2. Calculate annual total collisions using `COUNT(case_id)` grouped by year.
3. For each year and violation category, calculate the subtotal of collisions.
4. Compute the percentage of each category's collisions relative to the annual total.
5. Rank categories by their percentage within each year to identify top two.
6. Aggregate top two categories per year into a concatenated string.
7. Identify years where the top two categories' combination occurs uniquely once across all years.
8. Retrieve the distinct year(s) from the filtered results.
