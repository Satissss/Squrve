# Squrve

## Overview

**Squrve** is a lightweight and modular framework designed for rapid development and evaluation of `end-to-end` **Text-to-SQL** models. It integrates schema reduction, schema linking, and query generation into a flexible, configuration-driven pipeline. Users can quickly define and execute complex or concurrent tasks using JSON configuration filesâ€”no need to manually script task flows.

```
from core.base import Router
from core.engine import Engine

    router = Router(config_path="...")

    engine = Engine(router)

    engine.execute()
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All modules can be instantiated and executed independently for debugging.
- JSON configs allow plug-and-play model integration and fast benchmarking.
- Parallel execution is supported via `ParallelTask`.
