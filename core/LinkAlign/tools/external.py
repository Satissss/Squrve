Generate a concise knowledge package strictly derived from the provided technical documentation to enable SQL generation for non-specialist users. Follow this precise workflow:

1. Semantic Anchoring
# Identify and index all domain-specific elements using quadruples:(Concept, Mathematical Representation, SQL Mapping, Documentation Section)
# Build dependency chains using → notation between logically connected concepts

2. Precision Filtering
# Apply three-stage relevance scoring:
a) Direct Match: Concepts with lexical overlap (+3 weight)
b) Contextual Neighbors: Co-occurring terms within 5 tokens (+2 weight)
c) Formula Components: Variables in target SQL's WHERE/JOIN clauses (+4 weight)

3. Compact Structuring
# Organize knowledge using SQL-aware hierarchy:
[Core Components]
• Essential definitions with explicit SQL mapping
• Key formulas → Convert to SQL-compatible constraints
[Derivation Toolkit]
• Subquery templates from documentation examples
• Unit-conversion factors (preserve original notations)
• Boundary conditions affecting JOIN/WHERE clauses

4. SQL-Ready Formatting
# Encode formulas as \boxed{{}} with SQL translation comments
# Mark subquery patterns with {{SQL}}
# Prefix each entry with [KD-#][Section X.Y]

### Validation Checklist:
a. Every SQL-relevant term has documentation-backed definition
b. Formula variables map to database schema elements
c. No standalone concepts - full dependency paths maintained
d. Maximum 12 knowledge units with dependency depth ≤3

### Example Output:
[KD-1][Section 3.2] Entropy Threshold
• System stability criterion: \boxed{{S < k\log W}}
→ {{SQL}} WHERE entropy < log(possible_states)*k
→ Links [KD-3][KD-7]

[KD-2][Section 4.1] Thermal Diffusion
• \boxed{{\alpha = \frac{{k}}{{\rho c_p}}}} (ρ: density [kg/m³])
→ Maps to JOIN material_properties ON temp_diffusivity = α

### Response Format:
[KD-#][Section X.Y] ConceptName
• Definition/Equation (Units)
→ {{SQL}} ImplementationNote
→ Linked [KD-#]

### Question
{question}

### External Knowledge Document
{external}
