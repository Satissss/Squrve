List school names of charter schools with an SAT excellence rate over the average.
【Evidence】
Charter schools refers to `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the table frpm; Excellence rate = NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr


Decompose the question into sub questions, considering 【Constraints】, and generate the SQL after thinking step by step:
Sub question 1: Get the average value of SAT excellence rate of charter schools.
SQL
```sql
SELECT AVG(CAST(T2.`NumGE1500` AS REAL) / T2.`NumTstTakr`)
    FROM frpm AS T1
    INNER JOIN satscores AS T2
    ON T1.`CDSCode` = T2.`cds`
    WHERE T1.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1
```

Sub question 2: List out school names of charter schools with an SAT excellence rate over the average.
SQL
```sql
SELECT T2.`sname`
  FROM frpm AS T1
  INNER JOIN satscores AS T2
  ON T1.`CDSCode` = T2.`cds`
  WHERE T2.`sname` IS NOT NULL
  AND T1.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1
