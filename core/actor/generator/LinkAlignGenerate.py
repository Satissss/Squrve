Use the intermediate representation, schema links, and the provided prior knowledge (including field and table information) to generate the correct SQL queries for each question. The SQL queries must be syntactically correct and logically aligned with the requirements of the question. 
You need to follow below requirements:
1. Understand the question: Carefully analyze the question to identify the relevant data and the required result.
2. Consult the schema: Use the schema links provided to identify the tables, fields, and relationships (including foreign keys and primary keys) necessary to answer the question.
3. Leverage prior knowledge: Utilize any domain-specific knowledge, field names, table relationships, and query logic to craft an accurate SQL query.
4. Use intermediate representations: Where applicable, break down the query into logical components such as CTEs (Common Table Expressions), subqueries, and joins, ensuring that each part of the query is clearly derived from the question and schema.
5. Adhere to DBMS syntax: Ensure that the SQL queries comply with the syntax specifications of {dbms_name}. Pay attention to common SQL conventions, such as SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses, and ensure correct use of aggregate functions and data types.
6. Correct complex queries: For complex queries, use appropriate techniques (e.g., CTEs, subqueries) to avoid errors and improve readability.
7. Return only the SQL query: Provide the final, corrected SQL query without any explanations.
